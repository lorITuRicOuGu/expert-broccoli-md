## Abstract

This work describes the lyophilization process validation and consists of two parts. Part I \(Part I: Process Design and Modeling\) focuses on the process design and is described in the previous paper, while the current paper is devoted to process qualification and continued process verification. The goal of the study is to show the cutting edge of lyophilization validation based on the integrated community-based opinion and the industrial perspective.

This study presents best practices for batch size determination and includes the effect of batch size on drying time, process parameters selection strategies, and batch size overage to compensate for losses during production. It also includes sampling strategies to demonstrate batch uniformity as well as the use of statistical models to ensure adequate sampling.

Based on the LyoHUB member organizations survey, the best practices in determining the number of PPQ runs are developed including the bracketing approach with minimum and maximum loads. Standard practice around CQA and CPP selection is outlined and shows the advantages of using control charts and run charts for process trending and quality control.

The case studies demonstrating the validation strategy for monoclonal antibody and the impact of the loading process on the lyophilization cycle and product quality as well as the special case of lyophilization for dual-chamber cartridge system are chosen to illustrate the process validation. The standard practices in the validation of the lyophilization process, special lyophilization processes, and their impact on the validation strategy are discussed.

## **1 **Introduction

Lyophilization is a commonly used manufacturing process to prepare dried solid dosage forms of drug molecules that are vulnerable to physical and chemical degradation in the liquid state. The lyophilization process involves three steps: freezing, primary drying, and secondary drying. In the first step, a frozen matrix is formed wherein water is converted into ice crystals leaving behind solutes in the interstitial spaces. In the second step, frozen water is removed by sublimation under vacuum and low-temperature conditions. In the third and final step, the remaining unfrozen water is removed by desorption at relatively high temperatures.

A successful lyophilization process results in lyophilizates that have low residual moisture content and are free from physical defects. In addition, the lyophilization process must be robust over a range of critical process parameters and result in drug products with consistent quality attributes within and across batches. Due to the complex nature of the lyophilization process and the interactions between several product and process parameters, the development, scale-up, and validation of a robust lyophilization process require a thorough understanding of the product and process conditions, as well as the capabilities of the lyophilization equipment.

In general, pharmaceutical process validation protocols are developed following the current United States Food and Drug Administration \(US FDA\) guidance to the industry \[1\]. The objective of the lyophilization process validation is the demonstration of the homogeneity of product critical quality attributes \(CQAs\) within any given batch and their reproducibility across batches to assure that the quality, safety, and efficacy of the drug product is consistent and hence suitable for commercial distribution.

Over the past four decades, the validation of the lyophilization process has been specifically addressed in two reports by Jennings in 1986 \[2\] and Trappler in 2007 \[3\]. Ever since the publication of the latter report, several advances have been attained in lyophilization technologies, process analytical technology \(PAT\), computer models of lyophilization process and equipment capability, and the application of the elements of the quality-by-design \(QbD\) paradigm. Accordingly, an update of the best practices of the validation of lyophilization processes is needed especially given the surge in the number of therapeutic modalities in development pipelines that require lyophilization.

The authors of this paper aim to provide the current perspectives of the pharmaceutical industry on the best practices to meet the expectations of the regulatory authorities on process validation as it pertains to the lyophilization unit operation. The validation of other sterile manufacturing unit operations associated with the freeze-dried product is not the focus of this paper and will only be discussed in cases where the validation of these unit operations are impacted by the validation protocol of the lyophilization process. The discussion in this paper is mainly focused on the lyophilization of aqueous formulations in glass vials, and for completion a case study on dual-chamber syringes will also be shared. Additionally, practical case studies of validation for different therapeutic modalities including therapeutic proteins and vaccines are included for illustration. Moreover, the current perspectives regarding the use of process modeling to support the validation activities are critically discussed along with illustrative examples.

The US FDA encourages drug manufacturers to use modern pharmaceutical development concepts, quality risk management, and quality systems during the life cycle of the manufacturing process. Accordingly, in this paper, we take into consideration the current US FDA guidance to the industry on process validation \[1\] as well as the International Conference on Harmonization \(ICH\) guidance for the industry on Pharmaceutical Development \(Q8\), Quality Risk Management \(Q9\), and Pharmaceutical Quality System \(Q10\). Here, however, we do not discuss the validation of automated process control systems \(e.g., computer hardware and software interfaces\), which are commonly integrated into modern drug manufacturing equipment but could be relevant to the validation of processes that include automated equipment.

## **2 **Lyophilization Process Validation

Part I of this best practices’ publication focuses on the early stages of lyophilization product development and process validation**Error\! Bookmark not defined.** with an emphasis on the generation of a design space associated with a given product and equipment. Part II is intended to serve as a continuation of that effort with an emphasis on process qualification, specifically on the qualification of the equipment, as well as process performance qualification \(PPQ\) and continued process verification as currently practiced across various industry partners.

### **2.1 **Stage 1: Process Design

In Part I: Process Design and Modeling \(i.e., Stage 1\), the validation activities for pharmaceutical lyophilization were applied to increase the efficiency of Stages 2 and 3. Particularly, the process of product- and equipment-specific design space generation and modeling applications were demonstrated. The illustrative case studies are demonstrated to show the value of modeling. The described activities are aimed at improving the process understanding and preparing for Stages 2 and 3 which are described below.

### **2.2 **Stage 2: Process Qualification

After the completion of Stage 1, the designed process needs to be evaluated to determine if it is capable of reproducible manufacturing at the commercial scale. As it pertains to lyophilization, Stage 2 has two main goals: \(1\) qualification of the lyophilization equipment including all associated utilities, PAT, and controls and \(2\) qualification of the freeze-drying process performance including the loading and unloading processes. This is further described in detail below.

#### ***2.2.1 ***Qualification of the Lyophilization Equipment

Qualification of the lyophilizer involves a series of functional tests designed to verify that the utility systems and the equipment operate following the process requirements over all the anticipated operating ranges. This testing is typically done during the installation and operational qualification \(IQ/OQ\) upon installation and commissioning. Some of the qualification testing relevant to lyophilization process modeling and scale-up \(e.g., measuring the vial heat transfer coefficient and determining the equipment capability curve\) is not usually carried out during IQ/OQ. Such tests can be done before starting the lyophilization process qualification or replaced by values obtained using computational modeling. Also, similar to all multiple-use equipment, cleaning and sterilization-in-place procedures have to be qualified. Examples of qualification tests for the commercial-scale manufacturing lyophilizer are listed in Table 1. 


***Table 1*** 
Recommended qualification tests for the commercial-scale manufacturing lyophilizer. These tests are executed for each lyophilizer in the manufacturing lines



**Qualification test**

**Description and target specification**

Sensor calibration \(Standard IQ/OQ test\)

Temperature and pressure sensor calibration

Test repeated at specified intervals

Empty chamber temperature mapping: shelf and condenser \(Standard IQ/OQ test\)

The shelf surface temperature at any spot on one shelf or across shelves is within ±0.5 °C of the average after equilibration. The cooling rate from ambient to −45 °C at ≤ 1 °C/min can be achieved

The average shelf temperature is within ±0.5 °C of the set point after equilibration

The condenser should reach the setpoint ±2 °C and maintain that average temperature during the entire run. Condenser temperature is <−50 °C

Vacuum system \(Standard IQ/OQ test\)

A pressure of at least 50 mTorr can be achieved from ambient conditions within 1 h and can be maintained within ±5 units of the set point

Leak rate meets sterility specification. A frequently specified leak rate for clean, dry, and empty freeze-dryers would be 2 × 10–2 mbar-liter/sec \(15 μm \(mTorr\) liters per sec\) \[4\]

Condenser capacity \(Standard IQ/OQ test\)

The loss of weight from a weighed amount of water in trays is higher than the stated capacity of the condenser

Stoppering \(Standard IQ/OQ test\)

All vials are stoppered at the target nitrogen backfill pressure range \(250–750 Torr\) with no vial breakage or faulty stoppering

Cleaning and sterilization in place cycles \(Standard IQ/OQ test\)

Repeated at fixed intervals to maintain the validation status of the lyophilizer

Certain drug products may require specific cleaning validation procedures

Additional specific tests \(Standard IQ/OQ test if capabilities are included\)

IQ/OQ of controlled ice nucleation system

IQ/OQ of a tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy \(TDLAS\) system

Hydrocarbon and silicone contamination \(Non-standard IQ/OQ test\)

Silicone levels on swabs should not exceed the negative control. Hydrocarbon levels on swabs should not exceed the negative control

This procedure must be run after a lyophilization cycle. Do not use siliconized stoppers in the lyophilizer

Equipment capability \(Non-standard IQ/OQ test\)

Minimal controllable chamber pressure at a given sublimation rate \(choke condition\)

Microbial and particulate monitoring test \(Non-standard IQ/OQ test\)

Cleaning cycles must be sufficient to prevent cross contamination. Spike and swab locations used during cleaning validation must be justified. All support equipment such as trays, rakes, and forceps must be cleaned and sterilized using validated procedures and handled according to good aseptic practices to prevent their contamination. Soiled, clean, and sterile hold times must be established and qualified

Limits/specifications are also applied to these indirect surfaces besides direct product contact surfaces used in filling operations. As an example from our contributors, the shelves can be contaminated with product solution, dried in a simulated cycle, collapsed, cleaned, and a swab sample taken from the shelf and above shelf. In addition to removal of potential product residues, a program for cleaning the chamber of broken glass, and lost components must also be defined

Mass spectrometry, RGA, filter integrity tester \(Non-standard IQ/OQ test\)

In the case of stand-alone unit, the IQ/OQ will be done separately or at the same time during the IQ/OQ of the FD. In the case of integration to the main controller, these functionalities are usually tested as part of the IQ/OQ testing



#### ***2.2.2 ***Lyophilization Process Performance Qualification

The approach to process performance qualification \(PPQ\) should be based on sound scientific rationale and leverage the cumulative data from all relevant studies to establish the commercial manufacturing lyophilization process. The PPQ batches should involve increased sampling, testing, and scrutiny of the process performance compared to routine commercial batches to confirm consistent product quality within and between batches.

The PPQ runs are conducted according to a written protocol that is typically communicated to the regulatory agencies in advance to seek their input before execution. The protocol should include the validation plan for all manufacturing unit operations that precede and follow lyophilization in the process train. With regard to lyophilization, the protocol should include specific details about batch size, the primary package configuration \(vial type and size, stopper type, and fill height\), the lyophilization process parameters’ \(e.g., shelf temperature, drying chamber pressure, condenser temperature\) ranges and/or limits, and the process data to be collected. The protocol should also specify the sampling plan and acceptance criteria for in-process characterization \(e.g., residual moisture and/or headspace oxygen, etc.\), and release testing as well as details of the statistical methods to be used for analyzing the process data and the testing samples. Additionally, if computational modeling is employed to justify the number and design of the runs, and the associated testing plans and details of the models used should be included.

Once the protocol is approved internally as well as by the regulatory authorities, the collected data from the PPQ runs are analyzed, and a detailed report is written to document protocol execution, data analysis, any process deviations, and non-conformances, and the conclusions of the PPQ. If the results of the PPQ meet all acceptance criteria, the product is cleared for commercial production and launch. Notably, the validation of all unit operations, including but not limited to lyophilization, have to be successful for the drug product to be cleared.

### **2.3 **Stage 3: Continued Process Verification

The third and final stage of process validation is to continuously monitor the performance of the lyophilization process during the manufacturing of the subsequent commercial batches to confirm that the process remains within the validated operating ranges that would yield consistent product quality. This is achieved by establishing an ongoing process to collect and analyze data of the incoming raw materials, the finished drug product, and the process data that are deemed relevant to product quality. The data collection and analysis should be executed following robust statistical methods as well as appropriate qualitative approaches. Additionally, the qualification of the lyophilization equipment should be performed periodically to ensure that the process performance remains within the validated limits. Qualification, or re-qualification, of equipment is generally only done on a “per-cause” basis. For example, calibration checks are done as per performance rather than for continued process verification management. Qualification is performed as part of IQ/OQ and not each time PPQ runs are done. As such, re-qualifications are done based on the site validation master plan and change management procedures. In cases where qualifications are not done, the rationale should be provided.

Historically, when a sufficient number of batches has been manufactured, process capability can be established; the level and frequency of monitoring and routine sampling of the subsequent batches can be determined. In cases where the data collected during the verification stage suggest that certain changes should be implemented due to changes in the equipment or the drug product, an amendment of the protocol and, if required, additional validation runs should be approved and completed. In certain scenarios, these changes are planned and anticipated at or before the qualification stage. In such cases, change management protocols \[5\] are typically written and communicated to the regulatory authorities for approval before the introduction of change. Examples of such situations include changes in the fill height/volume and/or vial size and changes in the lyophilization process.

In the following sections of this paper, each of the aforementioned stages of lyophilization process validation is discussed in detail along with the perspectives of the authors on the recommended best practices to ensure successful validation.

## **3 **Current Practices in Lyophilization Process Validation

PPQ of lyophilization \(Stage 2 of process validation\), like many other processes, has historically relied on the three-drug product lot validation for a given cycle and dose where the validation consists of repeating the process in three consecutive batches of product for a given product image. This is coupled with expanded sampling for critical quality attributes that are most impacted by the lyophilization process, e.g., visual appearance, residual moisture, potency, and reconstitution time. Although the FDA has provided inspection guidance on lyophilization \[6\], it does not include great detail about PPQ runs, as the guidance predates the current three-stage validation model. To benchmark and understand the current validation practices, Lyophilization Technology Hub \(LyoHub\), an industry-academia consortium to advance the science and technology of lyophilization, surveyed its industry members that confirmed these practices continue today \(Table 2\).

Assumption: Drug product will be filed with the US FDA. The survey question as asked to the industry leads is listed here. How many runs would you typically do for each of the following scenarios? Assume the same formulation composition in all scenarios. What lyo load would you use for these runs for a low or a high volume product?




In the survey of six member companies, 90% answered that they use a standard of three maximum load plus one minimum load batch for PPQ. Member companies were also asked about any instances where more or less than three runs were used for validation. Product families with multiple strengths, fill volumes, etc. typically require more than three PPQ batches, but the total number of batches required can be minimized by testing only the representative worst-case configurations. Where multiple lyophilizers are to be used, demonstrated lyophilizer equivalence may be used to allow a minimum of three maximum load batches with at least one in each equivalent cabinet plus one minimum load batch in any one cabinet. These examples are further exemplified in table format with relevant case studies and survey findings from industry partners \(Tables 2, 3, and 4\).

Survey question asked to the industry leads is listed here: “How many runs would you typically do for each of the following scenarios? Assume the same formulation composition in all scenarios. What lyo load would you use for these runs for a low or a high volume product?”

The survey question as asked to the industry leads is listed here: “How many runs would you typically do for each of the following scenarios? Assume the same formulation composition in all scenarios. What lyo load would you use for these runs for a low or a high volume product?”




Sampling plans are also an important part of the lyophilized product validation process. The LyoHub member companies were surveyed regarding the types of sampling schemes that are used for lyophilization. The most common sampling plan, at 67%, was the pulling of samples at all four corners and from the center of the shelf for each loaded shelf of the lyophilizer. Additional sampling methods included from the top, middle, bottom, and left and right sides of the lyophilizer and may be based on an internal QbD approach. The focus of the sampling plan is to cover a wide range of locations to show product homogeneity across the lyophilizer. The most common critical quality attributes \(CQAs\) tested by the member companies were visual appearance, residual moisture, potency, and reconstitution time. Cake appearance, may or may not be, a CQA and product performance \(e.g., stability, potency, etc.\), needs to be correlated to appearance to fully appreciate the value of cake collapse.

The last area of focus in the survey covered process modeling and the use of the design space for lyophilization. In general, these areas are of growing interest to the member companies. When asked about the creation and use of a design space for lyophilization, 80% of member companies use it, but only one company has submitted a filing to the US FDA that has included the design space. The next section of this best practice paper will focus in detail on lyophilization process validation and ways that modeling can be used to support the validation. As the design space and models used to create them have become more accepted, the models can also provide ways to minimize the number of validation runs. Given the diversity of approaches used across the industry, the authors decided to compile a white paper that provides a harmonized recommendation for best practices as well as a future outlook for the use of modeling.

## **4 **Stage 2: Process Performance Qualification

PPQ is the second part of Stage 2 of process validation. According to the FDA Guidance \(2011\), *Process Validation**: General Principles and Practice* \[5\], the goal of PPQ is to demonstrate that the commercial manufacturing process performs as expected and confirms process design through the use of the following five elements: \(i\) qualified facility and utilities, \(ii\) equipment and components, \(iii\) trained personnel, \(iv\) well-understood manufacturing process, and \(v\) control procedures \[5\]. Successful completion of PPQs is required before commencing commercial production of the drug product batches. The approach for PPQ should be based on manufacturers’ sound scientific understanding of the product and manufacturing process and its relation to the combined use of the five elements mentioned above. Manufacturing conditions during PPQs are often based on an understanding of the qualified scale-down process models and the cumulative data generated during clinical manufacturing and small scale, pilot, and commercial-scale studies. It is expected that PPQ will involve extensive sampling, additional testing, and higher scrutiny to ensure homogeneity in drug product quality throughout the batch. The duration to continue extensive sampling and additional testing should be based on a continued process verification program which includes considerations for the volume of production, process complexity, understanding of the process, and experience with similar products and processes \[5\].

The following prerequisites are typically completed before the execution of a PPQ study: 

+ 
Identification of the glass transition temperature of the frozen matrix \(*T*g′\) and collapse temperature or critical temperature which is an indication of the product failure point

+  
Facility design/equipment/automation/utility installation, operational, and performance qualification, where applicable

+  
Drug substance \(API\) validation \(for drug product validation\)

+  
Rationale documented for selection of critical quality attributes \(CQAs\) and critical process parameters \(CPPs\) and their respective specifications and process parameter ranges

+  
Aseptic process qualification/validation \(simulation challenge if applicable\)

+  
Sterilization/depyrogenation validation \(if applicable\)

+  
Validation of sterilizing filters \(if applicable\)

+  
Container closure integrity validation \(if applicable\)

+  
Analytical methods validation/verification/qualification \(including PAT methods\)

+  
Data analysis report containing an assessment of development/historical process data to support the selection of acceptance criteria for statistically based sampling plans

+  
Standard operating procedures \(SOPs\) required for process validation written and approved

+  
Preventive maintenance \(PM\) program implemented

+  
Training \(GMP and process specific\)

+  
Approved PPQ protocol containing pre-defined acceptance criteria

+  
Equipment verified clean before processing




It should be noted that cleaning validation may be performed concurrently with PPQ, and the list above is not meant to be prescriptive. Before returning the equipment to commercial processing after the completion of PPQ, however, either cleaning validation must be completed and approved, or a successful cleaning verification must be performed.

### **4.1 **PPQ Protocol

The protocol for lyophilized products has specific elements to assure that the manufacturing process will consistently produce a drug product that meets all predefined acceptance criteria.

#### ***4.1.1 ***Batch Size

Minimum and maximum batch sizes for lyophilized products are defined in terms of the shelf load. For example, for a lyophilizer with ten shelves, a minimum batch size for one specific drug product configuration could be one shelf load, and the maximum batch size could be the ten shelf load. Note that the maximum batch size for compounding and lyophilizer can be different.

PPQ protocol should include the type and number of vials or units to be loaded for the minimum and maximum batch size. Depending on the production volume, it may be acceptable to use one partially filled shelf as the minimum load \(especially for low turnover products\) provided that the product quality of the batch is supported by appropriate commercial-scale studies and manufacturing controls.

The following are some considerations to take while determining batch sizes: 

+ 
In terms of the lyophilization cycle, partial or small batch sizes are expected to complete the drying faster than bigger batch sizes \[7\].

+  
The upper range of lyophilization cycle parameters for sublimation \(i.e., shelf temperature, chamber pressure\) should be set to avoid product failure.

+  
When deciding on the size of the small batch, care should be taken to account for filling line losses, in process, and release samples \(i.e., dead volume, sampling plan, and release criteria\).

+  
Lyophilizers must be capable of maintaining pressure within the acceptable range. The maximum batch size presents the worst case for sublimation and condenser capacity with the amplified center to edge vial Kv differences. Therefore, lyophilization cycle parameters should be carefully selected and/or verified to generate a vapor flux that can be supported by the lyophilizers at the maximum batch size. Additionally, the maximum batch size should be selected such that total net water to be removed is always below condenser capacity \(quantity of water in the form of ice that can be deposited on the condenser surface\).

+  
Allocated liquid hold time should allow for maximum batch size to be filled and loaded in the lyophilizer. This is especially true for vaccines wherein time in solution \(TIS\) is a critical process parameter and potency can be lost per hour while waiting to load the full cabinet. Similar would be the case for an antibody program where phase separation is observed over time and thus worst-case TIS should be used for consistent product performance.

+  
Location of shelf for small batch is also important. For instance, if the validation is done on the top shelf, subsequent commercial batches should be the same shelf.




#### ***4.1.2 ***Number of PPQ Lots

A pre-defined number of PPQ lots are manufactured to generate a robust understanding of the variability in the manufacturing process. Data from the PPQ batches must provide a high degree of assurance that the manufacturing process is reproducible, implementation of the control strategy is robust, and hence support the commercial release of the drug product. Determination of the number of lots to manufacture depends on many factors, for example, the complexity of the manufacturing process and product, variability in the manufacturing process, process understanding gained during scale-down and commercial-scale studies, and overall experience of the manufacturer with the manufacturing process.

Three batches at maximum lyophilizer load and one batch at minimum lyophilizer load were suggested during the CASS CMC Strategy forum in 2016 \[8\]. However, with appropriate justification based on a sound manufacturing control strategy, it is acceptable to use a different approach for the number of PPQ batches. Tables 2, 3, and 4 present the results of a survey for the number of PPQ batches used by *six* pharmaceutical companies for lyophilized products.

In cases where two dose strengths and more than one lyophilizer are in the scope of PPQ, a bracketing approach can be used to minimize the number of PPQ runs. It is recommended that appropriate studies are in place to demonstrate the functional equivalency of lyophilizers to minimize the number of PPQ runs by being able to use the lyophilizers interchangeably between the PPQs and also for commercial manufacturing flexibility.

Below are the results of a survey for the number of PPQ runs at maximum and minimum lyophilizer loads used by various pharmaceutical companies for four cases \(Table 5\).

Generally speaking, there was a consensus across industry leads on the conservative definition of lyophilizer equivalency. The same manufacturer, model, and size, for example, were unanimously considered as equivalent. Units from the same manufacturer with a matching model size but different manufacturing dates were considered equivalent only after performing, comparable equipment capability curve with *K*v value and temperature mapping comparison. However, a thorough discussion prompted the need to define the equivalency of lyophilization cabinets based on mechanical equivalency and process equivalency. Mechanical equivalency can be determined by equipment validations factors such as minimum/maximum shelf temperature, maximum sublimation rate, minimum controllable pressure, and condenser temperature, while process equivalency is determined by making batches of the same product in each lyophilizer and performing statistical analysis of the product attributes in both lyophilizers \(assay, water content, etc.\) to see if product generated in both lyophilizers is equivalent.

Cases E and F \(Table 5\), for example, may provide the number of PPQ runs for two dose strengths. As mentioned above, the bracketing or matrixing approach is acceptable to minimize PPQ runs when applicable. To apply bracketing, one approach may rely on categorizing the dose strengths into high risk \(HR\) and low risk \(LR\) for impact by the lyophilization unit operation at maximum load and then determine the total number of PPQ runs to bracket LR dose strength. These differences between the dose strengths need to be taken into consideration for risk categorization. As an example, for lyophilized formulations containing protein and sugar, a change in protein concentration may also necessitate a change in protein to sugar ratio, a change in the fill volume may necessitate a change in the vial size, and these changes may require the use of different lyophilization cycles.

Tables 6 and 7 provide an example of an approach to categorize dose strengths as high risk for model drug product configuration with low and high protein:sugar ratio. It is assumed that the same lyophilization cycle is used for both dose strengths.

#### ***4.1.3 ***Potential CPPs to Be Monitored

A PPQ protocol includes set points and ranges for process parameters’ alarm limits for the lyophilization cycle. PPQs are run at “target” process parameters, which along with their ranges are defined based on scale-down or commercial-scale studies conducted before PPQ as defined in the section on process design studies. Normal operating ranges for lyophilization cycle process parameters are always within the process parameter ranges.

Process parameters relevant to the lyophilization cycle recipe are as follows: 

+ 
Freezing: shelf temperature

+  
Primary drying: shelf temperature and chamber pressure

+  
Secondary drying: shelf temperature and chamber pressure




Additional process parameters recommended for process monitoring of the lyophilization cycle include Pirani pressure, nitrogen bleed rate, condenser temperature, and condenser pressure. A typical lyophilization recipe is provided in Table 8.

#### ***4.1.4 ***Potential CQAs to Be Tested

In addition to the CQAs related to the physicochemical and biological properties of the drug product, CQAs specific to the lyophilized product such as cake appearance, residual moisture, and reconstitution time are also part of the release control system. The PPQ protocol should include the rationale for the inclusion of each CQA and sampling frequency. For example, deviation in process parameters, such as shelf temperature, chamber pressure, and primary drying time, outside of the acceptable ranges during a lyophilization cycle can impact cake appearance, residual moisture, and reconstitution time, and hence these attributes are assessed during process validation. To demonstrate uniformity in drug product quality attributes throughout the batch of vials, extensive sampling is performed for PPQ batches. Residual moisture is one attribute that is tested more extensively than the rest of the CQAs. To demonstrate drying uniformity throughout the lyophilizer\(s\), samples are collected from various locations on the shelves. The selection of shelf locations and the number of samples collected from each location should be based on prior knowledge of variability in shelf surface temperature and moisture. The locations selected for sample collections should be the worst cases in terms of impact on moisture content. Shelf surface temperature variability relative to hot and cold shelf temperature setpoints should be measured during initial equipment qualification and periodic maintenance. Data from these studies serve to identify worst-case locations. Additionally, the impact of shelf surface temperature variability on moisture content can be determined by conducting lyophilization runs using an appropriate surrogate-lyophilized product. Together, these studies help in the identification of worst-case locations with hot and cold temperatures on the surface of the shelves. Typically, four corners and the center of each shelf are used as sampling locations since heat transfer to the product is expected to be lowest in the center \(cold vials\) and highest on the corners which may cause variability in the moisture results. It is recommended that a sampling plan for testing residual moisture be based on relevant statistics to be able to evaluate variability among different locations and the probability of exceeding lot release specification. If a particular location\(s\) is known to be more variable in shelf surface temperature, this information should be used in the statistical model to determine the appropriate number of samples. Testing of all CQAs from the top, middle, and bottom shelves is recommended to demonstrate drying uniformity in the lyophilizer. Table 9 summarizes the recommended product critical quality attributes to be tested in each of the PPQ batches of an exemplary protein product.

aNo statistically significant difference between samples in each location and across samples from different locations on the same shelf and between shelves.

The number of samples used for testing should be more than what is required to complete all the testing and to provide for any retests. Additionally, the number of data points \(replicates\) for each test should be adequate to provide quantitative evidence of inter and intra batch variability. The use of qualified high-throughput analytical methods such as near infrared \(NIR\) spectroscopy for moisture testing is acceptable for testing validation samples. A bridging study is required between the high-throughput analytical method and lot release analytical method used for testing of validation samples and lot release samples, respectively, to be able to use the validation samples to rationalize sampling plan for lot release testing and specification acceptance criteria \[9\].

## **5 **Stage 3: Continued Process Verification

Continued process verification is categorized as Stage 3 of process validation. Manufacturing firms are required to establish and maintain a continuous monitoring program to, at a minimum, annually report the process and product quality data \[5\]. The purpose of this program is to assure that the manufacturing process is in a state of control throughout the life cycle of the product. The data and information generated during the program also form the basis for identifying improvements to the manufacturing process.

In this life cycle management state, a continued verification program links the operational elements of the quality system, such as annual product review and change control, to continuous improvement initiatives for the manufacturing process. Fundamental to achieving these goals is the selection and trending of process parameters and quality attributes concerning their specifications. Control and run charts using historical data are used for depicting any atypical and unexpected shifts and patterns in the process parameters and quality attributes over time. The atypical or special cause variation is different from common cause variation in that special cause variation in the process can be attributed to an assignable cause which can be removed through corrective actions leading to process improvement. A well-established set of rules \(such as Nelson rules \[10\] or Western electric rules \[11\]\) can be used to detect patterns in the process monitoring data and indicate special cause variation.

### **5.1 **Use of Run or Control Chart

A run chart shows a general trend of a process parameter over time. For example, for chamber pressure, it can be the data collected every minute over the different stages of the lyophilization cycle. For multiple batches manufactured in a year, a run chart can be constructed by plotting maximum and minimum values of the chamber pressure for each batch. Different options for plotting a run chart are provided in the section below.

A control chart is a statistical quality control tool to show process stability – average and variability in a process parameter. Variability is expressed in terms of upper control limits \(UCL\) and lower control limits \(LCL\). Typically, UCL and LCL are calculated as average ± 3 × standard deviation and reflect process stability. In a perfectly stable process, assuming data variation is normally distributed \(random, uncontrolled variation inherent to the process – common cause variation\), 68% of the data should fall within 1 standard deviation, 95% of the plotted data should fall within 1.96 standard deviations, and 99.73% of the data should fall within 3 standard deviations \[12\]. Control charts may also have specifications for quality attributes and process parameters \(upper specification limit \(USL\) and lower specification limit \(LSL\)\) which are wider than UCL and LCL. Specifications for quality attributes are derived during stages 1 and 2 of drug product process validation wherein the impact of critical material attributes \(CMAs\) and process parameters on quality attributes is established. Understanding the impact of CMAs and process parameters on quality attributes together with the safety and efficacy data from clinical studies is used to establish specifications for quality attributes.

Figure 1 depicts a hypothetical example of a trend chart for minimum and maximum chamber pressures for each of the 30 batches of a drug product. As a worst-case, 0–10% variability relative to a set point pressure of 100 mTorr was randomly applied to each of the 30 batches. UCL and LCL were calculated using average ± 3 × standard deviation in pressure data for 30 batches. Note that the USL and LSL of 120 and 80 mTorr are acceptable process parameter limits derived from lyo process robustness studies performed during Stage 1 – process design of the process validation. For demonstration purposes, pressure data for batches 2 and 3 were shown to be slightly outside the UCL and LCL, respectively.

To identify whether there is a shift or pattern in the data, a control chart was constructed \(Fig. 2\). Here, average pressure data was plotted for 30 batches, and variation in the data was compared against the Nelson rules to identify shifts or patterns in the data. Variation in the data does not fall into any of the rules and therefore can be classified as common cause variation and corrective action is not needed.

### **5.2 **Selection of CQAs and CPPs to Use in the Plot

#### ***5.2.1 ***Lyophilized Products in Vials

Quality attributes including in-process controls and release testing of a drug product batch are in the scope of a continued verification program. It is expected that the criticality of these quality attributes is decided based on a scientifically sound control strategy as outlined in ICH Q11 following the principles of the quality risk management \(ICH Q8\). As part of developing a control strategy, it is also important to monitor changes in process inputs including excipients and container closure systems. For example, variation in glass vial dimensions may impact heat transfer to the product during lyophilization.

Quality attributes unique to the lyophilized products in vials are reconstitution time, residual moisture, headspace pressure, and lyophilized cake appearance. While reconstitution time, residual moisture, and headspace pressure are reported out as numeric values and hence are straightforward to use for statistical analysis using control charts, report out of cake appearance being descriptive cannot be used directly for statistical analysis. Percentage reject or more specifically percentage of cake defects per batch may alternatively be used for statistical process verification.

Another factor that does not negatively impact the deliverable dose and critical quality attributes of the product in vials but do impact the aesthetic/product elegance and to some extent the total yield is the presence of spots and streaks. Spots and streaks are referred to a phenomenon where the product is deposited on the body or on the shoulder of the vial. It is believed to occur due to product solution splashing during filling process which does not drip down into bulk solution but stays and gets frozen during freezing process and get lyophilized leaving behind white streaks and spots. Some of the corrective and preventive actions \(CAPA\) that can be applied to address these issues include optimization of the filling speed, the nozzle size, and the line speed to minimize the rocking of the vials on lines feeding into lyophilizer. A similar phenomenon called fogging is also seen commonly which is attributed to Marangoni flow where the liquid slowly rises even after carefully filling which gets lyophilized and leaves behind a white layer or mist of powder. It is believed that a hydrophobic coating of silicon oil inside the vial mitigates the problem \[13\]. In some cases the product solution can form a ring around the neck/shoulder which is referred to “Halos” during drawback of the needle in the filling process and is attributed to both filling speed and the static charges developed on the vial during the vial washing, drying, and depyrogenation steps of manufacturing. In such situations it can impact the deliverable dose if it does not get reconstituted with the normal reconstitution procedure/method and may require inverting the vial during reconstitution to get that powder reconstituted. If the product is found in the stopper area, then this could raise concern on container closure integrity \(CCI\) and could potentially be classified as reject.

Shelf temperature, chamber pressure, and time are lyophilization-specific critical process parameters having defined set points for different stages of the lyophilization process \(freezing ramp rate, freezing hold time, annealing ramp rate and hold time, primary and secondary drying shelf temperature ramp rates and hold times, chamber pressure set point during primary and secondary drying\). Depending on the specifications established for the process parameter for a given lyophilization stage and on the capability of the equipment to control the parameter within the specifications, not all process parameters may be categorized as critical process parameters and may not be included in the process monitoring program by default. Regardless, as a best practice, it is recommended to periodically monitor all aforementioned lyo cycle parameters.

Tests and checks performed during preventive maintenance of the lyophilizer should also be part of a continued verification program. Results from tests including empty chamber shelf mapping, leak rate with and without closing the isolation valve \(if present\), capability for fast and slow ramping of temperatures and pressures in the chamber and condenser, and control at minimum pressure are very valuable to monitor.

### **5.3 **Options for Plotting Variations in Control Chart

#### ***5.3.1 ***Sample

Variation in a process parameter for a single batch or multiple batches can be plotted using three options \[14\]: 

1. 
1.


Parameter variation: Using this option, process parameter values for each process step are plotted in a chart. For trend analysis of multiple batches, this plotting technique will yield a complicated graph which can be difficult to analyze.




2.  
2.


Deviation from target: Using this option, process data is plotted as a deviation from the set point for each process step. Similar to the previous option, this plotting technique will yield complicated graphs when multiple batches are included.




3.  
3.


Greatest variation using standard deviation or z-score: For a large number of batches, plotting all process data as standard deviation simplifies the construction and analysis of the data.

Methods B, C, and D are options where deviation from target or setpoint values is used for plotting. Methods F and G are options where a statistical output, such as standard deviation or range, is used for plotting the data. The decision of which options to choose for plotting largely depends on process characteristics, subgroup data size and data sampling frequency, need and sensitivity to detect small shifts in the process, and goal of the data analysis \[14\].

## **6 **Special Cases of Lyophilization Process Validation

### **6.1 **Validation Approaches to Freeze-Drying of Pharmaceuticals in Alternative Containers

#### ***6.1.1 ***Emerging and Existing Container Closure Systems

Dual-chamber containers \(vials \(DCVs\), syringes \(DCSs\), cartridges \(DCCs\)\) are emerging container closure systems developed to improve patient convenience during administration. The benefits of dual-chamber systems also include increased patient safety \(decreased number of dose preparation steps\), decreased dose administration errors \(reduction of admixture loss during reconstitution\), and cost reduction due to no need for separate diluent containers \[15\].

##### ***6.1.1.1 ***Dual Chamber Vials

A dual-chamber vial \(Act-O-Vial, as an example \[15\]\) comprises two compartments: the lower compartment contains lyophilized product , while the upper compartment is filled with the diluent. Compartments are separated by an elastomeric stopper. The product is filled and lyophilized followed by stopper placement and diluent fill operations. Due to the configuration, the container cannot be stoppered as they typically are within the lyophilizer; the lyophilized product is exposed to environmental conditions before stoppering. It is therefore critical to maintain low relative humidity and controls to prevent microbial contamination of the environment in which the product will be stoppered. To administer the content of a DCV, the user needs to press a plastic activator to push the stopper down to the lower compartment allowing the diluent to come in contact with the lyophilized powder. To make sure that the stopper moves smoothly, after the initiation of the activator, the stopper must be properly siliconized.

##### ***6.1.1.2 ***Dual Chamber Syringes and Cartridges

From the experiences of one company within LyoHub, dual-chamber syringes and dual-chamber cartridges have very similar designs \(cake and diluent are separated by a middle plunger stopper\) and differ only in size, with DCSs being larger \(up to 4 mL of diluent\). For administration, a DCS needs only a needle and a plunger, while a DCC requires a separate device. DCCs are typically placed within the device, while DCSs are stored as a kit containing all the accessories needed for administration. The sequence of operations during the manufacturing of DCSs and DCCs is slightly different as compared to DCVs. First, syringes or cartridges are siliconized followed by the middle stopper placement. A middle stopper is positioned just below the bypass. Then devices are filled with the solution over the top of a middle stopper. Few dual-chamber containers have specially designed lyo stoppers placed after the filling operation in a semi-stoppered position allowing water to escape during lyophilization. During drying, DCSs/DCCs are typically positioned in a “tip-up” configuration where the cakes sit on the top of the middle plunger. After lyophilization of the semi-stoppered DCSs/DCCs, the shelves are collapsed \(usually when the chamber is equilibrated at atmospheric pressure\), sealing the drug product compartment. The DCSs/DCCs are then unloaded, turned upside down \(typically by robotic systems\), filled with the diluent, and sealed with the second stopper. The requirements for room humidity and environmental controls are drastically reduced. Some DCCs, however, are sealed outside of the drying chamber, so requirements for environmental control are the same as for a DCV or even tighter \(RH < 10%\).

During the administration of the drug product that is filled into the DCSs/DCCs, a plunger rod attached to the second stopper is used to press the stopper and move the diluent toward the middle stopper. The middle stopper is then moved, opening a bypass for delivering the diluent to the drug product compartment. After complete reconstitution, the solution can be directly administered to the patient; no additional steps are needed.

##### ***6.1.1.3 ***Trays

Tray drying is more common for the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients \(APIs\) or their intermediates. The requirements for sterile manufacturing of these materials are not as strict as the manufacture of the parenteral drug product in vials or DCSs/DCCs as sterile filtrations will be carried out later when the API/drug substance is processed into drug product. Yet the liquid product is typically filled into trays using principles of the aseptic technique to maintain a low bioburden. Trays may be covered during the transfer from the filling line to the shelves of the dryer. Trays are placed on the shelf, their cover is removed, and the operation is repeated until the dryer is fully loaded. To minimize the risk of cross-contamination and reduce product blow-out, disposable trays with water-permeable membranes are available commercially \[21\]. Regardless of the tray design, lyophilized API or product intermediate needs to be transferred to the storage containers or sealed inside aluminum secondary containers to prevent moisture uptake.

Despite apparent differences in containers, the validation principles remain the same: demonstrate product uniformity and the ability to consistently manufacture products \[8\].

#### ***6.1.2 ***Specifics of ***Heat and Mass Transfer*** in Dual Chamber Devices

To understand better validation requirements or validation strategies for the dual-chamber containers, the specifics of heat and mass transfer of such containers need to be understood. The bottom of a DCV is essentially the same as the bottom of a typical tubing vial of the same diameter delivering essentially the same heat per unit of surface. The contribution from the top shelf may be slightly different since a stopper is not used during drying with a DCV, but the difference in overall vial heat transfer coefficient seems to be very small \(unpublished data\). It is worth noting that the resistance of semi-inserted stopper, which is used in regular vial freeze-drying, is not that significant compared to the dry cake resistance. Thus, the overall heat and mass transfer during lyophilization of a DCV is not that different from the regular vial freeze-drying process. Simple steady-state primary drying models \[16\] can be successfully used to design a lyophilization cycle for DCVs.

The heat transfer in dual chamber syringes and cartridges is not well understood compared to the vials. One of the reasons is that DCSs/DCCs need some sort of support \(holders\) during drying which is not standardized across the industry. The three-dimensional design and material of construction of this DCS/DCC support systems will significantly impact the heat transfer and the drying characteristics of the product. Few studies on the mechanism of heat transfer in dual-chamber containers have been performed \[17–20\]. Patel and Pikal \[17\] explored the difference in the heat and mass transfer between custom made plexiglass and aluminum block holders showing significant improvement of heat transfer for aluminum block versus plexiglass holders \(at 100-mT chamber pressure, the heat transfer coefficient is 1.7 times higher for aluminum block holders\). They also reported there was almost no impact of pressure on Kv of plexiglass holders with an edge effect of about 70%. For the aluminum holder, the edge effect was only about 4%, while the pressure effect on Kv was similar to that of a typical vial. Korpus et al. \[20\] investigated Kv as a function of pressure for a custom-made aluminum holder in which the cake was “suspended” above the holder body by about 10–20 mm. It was found that this configuration produced poor heat transfer compared to the regular vials. They also demonstrated a significant edge effect \(50% more heat for the edge syringe at a pressure of 150 mT\). In other publications, Korpus and Friess \[18\] and Korpus et al. \[19\] explored different designs of holders: \(1\) aluminum holder \[20\]; \(2\) “shell holder,” where each syringe is placed in the individual metal holder; \(3\) flexible holder, where part of syringes containing cakes was “immersed” in the massive aluminum block suspended above the shelf; and \(4\) guide rail holder, where syringes were tightly packed within a metallic box while touching the shelf. The authors of these articles showed that the shell holder device was the most efficient for the heat transfer, both during freezing and drying, while also significantly reducing edge effects \[18\]. However, overall energy transfer was still around three times less effective than that for freeze-drying in a traditional vial container system in the same pressure range. Also, cleaning of such holders may be a challenging task. Shell-type holders are commercially available and are called “puck systems” and are currently utilized by Boehringer Ingelheim \[21\].

Besides “needle-up” systems, described above, “needle-down” technology was recently introduced by Werk et al. \[22\]. As opposed to “needle-up” systems, in which containers are held during drying with injection’s side up and then need to be inverted for the diluent filling, the container during the “needle-down” process \(drug product filling, drying, and diluent filling\) remains in the same orientation throughout. This allows keeping product close to the shelf and, with the implementation of advanced holders \(aluminum blocks\), guarantees good heat transfer. The potential risk of using such systems could be incomplete reconstitution of dried product residues in Luer cone or staked-in needle configurations and challenges during injection as a result of potential needle plugging.

An example evolution of commercially manufactured drug products in dual-chamber systems is shown in Fig. 4. In the original configuration, syringes were closely packed inside a metal box \(Fig. 4a\). Boxes were manually loaded on the shelves of the freeze-dryer. Temperature traces from the lyophilization process in this configuration show a significant temperature gradient \(approximately 7 °C\) between edge and center syringes. The apparent drying time, indicated by the temperature sensor, was almost six times longer for the center syringe. These data are comparable to the guiderail systems discussed by Korpus et al. \[18\]. Poor heat transfer and significant edge effect necessitated design changes of the holders \(“magazines”\) where syringes were separated to minimize the “shielding” effect \[23\]. To improve heat transfer, new holders were made of an aluminum alloy. Likely to reduce the weight of the “magazines,” holders were made short, leaving cakes above the heat transfer surface and allowing significant radiation from the walls of the dryer \(“suspended design” – Fig. 4b\) \[24\]. Edge effects caused a substantial temperature gradient between edge and center containers during both freezing \(14 °C\) and drying \(9 °C\). Therefore, this resulted in some variability of product quality \(differences between center and edge syringes in the degree of crystallinity, fragility, and Tg of dried material\). These differences required significant validation efforts to prove the comparability of the product within the batch. With a “suspended design,” DCCs had a similar edge effect as compared to the DCSs. The design of the holders was further improved so that DCCs were, at least partially, covered by the “magazine” body – the so-called “immersed design” \(Fig. 4c\) \[24\]. This “immersed design” resulted in close contact of the DCS with the holder resulting in improved heat transfer and significant reduction of the edge effect. The difference between edge and center containers was within 1 °C during freezing and earlier stages of drying \(Fig. 4c\). Due to improved homogeneity, an acceptable product temperature design space could be notably narrowed resulting in a less extensive robustness study.

Unlike drying in vials, a robust primary drying model for DCSs/DCCs has not been developed yet. For the “suspended design” holder type, a steady-state primary drying model was successfully used to predict the product temperature profile \(Fig. 5\) \[24\]. In this model, the contact area between the product and glass was considered as a heat transfer surface. For the “immersed design” holder, the contribution of the non-steady-state part of the cycle \(~12% of total heat utilized during sublimation \[24\]\) may not be completely neglected.

#### ***6.1.3 ***Specifics of Heat and Mass Transfer in Tray Drying

Freeze-drying in trays is a well-established technology used in food and pharmaceutical industries to process in bulk. It is therefore not surprising that robust primary and secondary drying models were developed more than 20 years ago \[25\]. In the biopharmaceutical industry, to the authors’ knowledge, tray drying is mostly used for the manufacture of drug substance, drug product intermediates, or APIs. Tray drying is generally conducted either in disposable plastic or reusable metal trays. Freeze-drying in trays has some specific considerations compared to vial freeze-drying. For example, solidification of water, after initial supercooling and ice nucleation, takes longer in trays versus vials. In some cases, one can visually see a movement of the freezing front from the edges to the center of the tray. In contrast, the freezing front progresses through the vial almost instantaneously. Due to slower freezing in trays, one could expect a larger cryo-concentration effect as compared to the vials and a higher likelihood of skin formation. Additionally, shrinkage and cracking of the product may be more pronounced in tray drying compared to vial drying for the same product. This could result in a reduction of heat transfer toward the end of primary drying. As an example, lyophilization in trays was compared to vial freeze-drying using a 5% sucrose solution as a model material. While the heat transfer coefficient of the vial and the tray at 50 mTorr were determined to be comparable, it took at least 20% longer for tray drying as compared to vial freeze-drying. Significant cracking and potential loss of contact with the bottom of the tray was suspected as a reason for the increase in drying time.

Reusable metal trays may be more robust to tearing and scratching when compared to plastic trays, but they may warp with time due to thermal treatment such as sterilization or washing which could change the tray heat transfer coefficient. Variability in heat transfer from shelf to tray \(warping\) or from tray to product \(cracking\) could significantly influence the endpoints of both primary and secondary drying. The endpoint determination \(by pressure comparative method or pressure rise test\) is more important for tray drying as compared to the vial drying, where vials are in direct contact with the shelf.

#### ***6.1.4 ***Validation Approaches for Dual Chamber Devices and Tray Drying

The validation strategy for products lyophilized in DCVs is similar to that of regular vial freeze-drying. Sterile filtration, filling, loading, and drying processes are almost the same for both media. One should also expect a similar product temperature design space because the heat transfer is not that different as compared to the regular vial freeze-drying. The biggest difference is that DCVs are not stoppered inside the dryer. The additional focus of the validation procedure for a DCV, therefore, is to demonstrate that product remains sterile and particle-free during unloading of a DCV and before the placement of the middle stopper. Also, moisture uptake before stopper placement should remain within the target, which is typically much lower than the upper limit of specification acceptance criteria. Maximum hold times and relative humidity limits should be defined between the unloading of the lyophilizer and the closure of the last container.

In DCS/DCC freeze-drying, due to poor heat transfer, metal boxes are not currently used. Therefore, the authors of this paper will focus on the validation of processes in “suspended design” and “immersed design” holders. In the example of “suspended design” \(Fig. 4b\), the lowest product temperature for an edge syringe was about −36 °C, while the shelf inlet temperature set point varied between −52 °C and −56 °C \(lowest achievable set point for this dryer\). This means that if the product required temperatures below −36 °C during freezing, this may not have been achievable for a portion of the batch in this type of holder for this particular dryer. Also, the difference in temperature between edge and center syringes was about 9 °C and 11 °C during primary and secondary drying, respectively. As a result, substantial robustness studies are needed to support a wide drug product temperature design space. Since the edge effect strongly depends on wall temperature, the best validation practice should also include the monitoring of the wall temperature during engineering runs to make sure that the edge effect is reproducible and acceptable for the edge containers. A minimum process restriction between the heat sterilization of the lyophilizer and the start of the lyophilization process needs to be in place to avoid unacceptable temperature distributions within the product. Ideally, modern freeze-dryers could be built with control and monitoring systems for the doors and walls. The impact of the process parameters’ variability on product quality should be documented, at least on a laboratory scale, to demonstrate the robustness of the commercial process. Freeze-dryers should also be capable of reducing the product temperature below the target for every single container during freezing regardless of the position. This may require validation of equipment capability and continued process verification to reach that low temperature and demonstrate that temperature is achievable across the shelf and between the shelves as a function of load. For example, for products with *T*g′ < −40 °C, shelf temperature should be below −60 °C for “suspended design” holders \(Fig. 4b\). If the formulation contains a bulking agent that requires a low nucleation temperature \(mannitol, sodium chloride\), a temperature of −36 °C may not be low enough to ensure complete crystallization. Variability in the crystallinity of the bulking agent could therefore be expected for the materials freeze-dried in this type of container holders. In addition to typical CQAs measured during PPQ \(moisture, reconstitution time, other product specific QAs\), the degree of bulking agent crystallinity, the specific surface area of dry powder, and the *T*g may be required to ensure that the quality of drug product produced during PPQ material remains within proven design space. Also, a substantial sampling plan \(i.e., few locations from each shelf within the chamber\) at PPQ is required to prove the homogeneity of the product during lyophilization.

Figure 4c depicts excellent heat transfer for the “immersed design” holders. The difference between edge and center DCCs did not exceed 1 °C until the later portion of primary drying. Unlike the notable differences between edge and center in the “suspended design,” the temperature gradient during secondary drying was less than 1 °C. The edge effect was even lower than that during typical vial drying. Thus, a robustness study and validation efforts for the “immersed design” configuration could be much less intensive, including a reduced sampling plan \(i.e., few locations from the bottom, middle, and top shelves of the chamber\). Variability in product quality may also be minimal due to very narrow design space and non-typical testing \(e.g., degree of crystallinity\) may not be required. Some DCCs are not semi-stoppered before loading into the dryer, and after completion of the cycle, lyophilized powder is exposed to environmental conditions until the last DCC is sealed. Thus, similar to DCVs, validation exercises should demonstrate that the product remains sterile and particle-free with the moisture being within specification during unloading of DCCs

A few challenges in the validation of products in dual-chamber containers are related to specifics of its design. Unlike with the regular vial configuration, in dual-chamber containers, drug product, diluent, or both are always in contact with the stopper. In most cases, to function properly after reconstitution, stoppers and glass barrels need to be siliconized before the filling and drying. Siliconization of stoppers could impact the number of leachables during storage which has to be evaluated concerning the product quality. Silicone oil could interfere with assays, so alternative analytical methods or more efforts in assay validation may be required for the dual chamber configurations. Siliconization could also impact product quality \(particle formation in reconstituted solution as one such example\), so additional robustness study may be required with representative containers. It is good practice for a robustness study to be performed with the containers treated the same way as would be expected during commercial manufacturing \(depyrogenation, siliconization, etc.\). One could also expect moisture transfer through the stopper during long term storage \[15\]. Thus, the stability of the product, associated with moisture transfer and leachables uptake, could vary depending on the commercial process. This could delay product approval from regulatory agencies as they may require actual stability data from a particular commercial site. Also, the strength of a dual-chamber product can be based on both the filling accuracy of the active and diluent fill \(depending on how the strength method is designed\). This combined with the low fill weight in DCC puts a high demand on the accuracy of the filling line.

## **7 **Case Studies

The process validation is exemplified with three case studies which include the validation strategy for different filling volumes and equipment; the chamber loading process effect on product quality and special case of the product in DCC lyophilization. The details of each case study are provided below.

### **7.1 **Monoclonal Antibody Case: Fill Volumes and Equipment Validation Strategy

A commercial monoclonal antibody lyophilized product with two different vial strengths \(“a” and “b” mg/vial\) is to be transferred within the same commercial manufacturing site to a different suite, resulting in a change of filling line and lyophilizer equipment. Besides, the new suite has two different lyophilizers \(Lyo A and Lyo B\) that would be used to manufacture the product. The PPQ protocol in the new suite consisted of four runs in total with two batches per product strength: three validation batches to be manufactured in one lyophilizer \(Lyo A\) to demonstrate batch-to-batch consistency and a fourth validation batch to be manufactured in the second lyophilizer \(Lyo B\) to demonstrate the equivalent performance of the two lyophilizers. The protocol requires that lyophilization process validation should be conducted under anticipated commercial manufacturing conditions. Performance qualification of critical processing equipment was conducted to verify that the equipment performed consistently within defined operating parameters when subjected to normal production conditions. Heat and moisture mapping studies were performed to demonstrate that the two lyophilizers were functionally equivalent. The operational process steps \(e.g., filling, lyophilization, etc.\) for the manufacturing of both strengths were similar, and the vial size and composition were the same for both product strengths; the only difference was in their respective filling volumes.

Table 12 shows the validation strategy included in the PPQ protocol at the new suite. Lot 1 represents the worst-case lyophilization condition for condenser capacity as vial strength “b” had a higher fill volume, i.e., a higher amount of water content \(per vial\) to be sublimed during primary drying. Lot 3 represents the best-case lyophilization condition, as vial strength “a” had a lower fill volume. Lyophilization-related parameters such as shelf temperature and chamber pressure during drying are considered to be critical process parameters and were monitored in-process. The normal operating range was established by trending process performance from development batches and equipment capability and was to be verified during validation. Samples are to be collected from locations throughout the lyophilization chamber for each batch size \(top-middle-bottom, front-middle-back, alternate, even, and odd shelves, the worst-case location from shelf mapping\) after the cycle. This sampling plan was proposed to demonstrate that products from all locations met pre-determined quality attributes. Testing verification with respect to the lyophilization process will be performed on the finished goods. The quality attributes of the lyophilized drug product will be demonstrated by analytical tests \(e.g., moisture content, cake appearance, product reconstitution time, degradants, particulates, potency\) and a microbial test \(BET\). This process validation strategy is expected to demonstrate that the manufacturing process was robust, capable, and reproducible at the target, upper, and lower limits of the proposed variable batch size \(110–250 L\) and that all CQAs and specifications associated with both product strengths are robust and reproducible at the new suite.

### **7.2 **Impact of Lyophilization Chamber Loading Process on Product Appearance and Product Rejection Rates

Process design, process qualification, and continued process verification ensure the development and scale-up of a robust, reproducible commercial manufacturing process while providing ongoing assurance that the process remains in a state of control. The case study is shown here and documents user experience associated with lyophilization of a complex live virus vaccine formulation. The reader is reminded that vaccines, by their intrinsic instability, often require the investigator to define additional CPPs such as time in solution \(TIS\), time out of refrigeration \(TOR\), etc., and in many instances are sensitive not only to the freezing protocol but also on final moisture content. Flash freezing, for example, is the freezing method of choice for live virus vaccines \(LVVs\) to minimize TIS. Similarly, low moisture may often result in low-drying yields for an LVV, while too high a moisture may compromise the shelf-life of the virus, and thus an optimal moisture condition is empirically determined. This is further illustrated by the live virus vaccine formulation case study wherein the chamber loading process had a significant effect on cake appearance due to inadvertent annealing during the loading step. The reader is referred to Wallen et al. \[26\] for a detailed description of the study design and a brief description of the study is provided below.

A validated freeze-dryer consisting of 18 mobile shelves with an out-swing door was used for the study. The form/fill process consisted of filling <1 mL \(fill height of 4.2 ± 0.2 mm\) of the formulation components in a 3-cc type 1 glass tubing glass vials partially stoppered with a slotted butyl rubber stopper. Vials were placed on a perforated tray, and the product was immediately flash-frozen to a temperature of approximately −100 °C using direct liquid nitrogen \(LN2\) injection freezer. Note that this process was optimized for the LN2 freezer to accommodate the sensitivity of the complex live virus vaccine. The product, once flash-frozen, was loaded onto freeze-dryer shelves that were cooled down to −50 °C manually by opening the dryer door, placing several trays \(eight trays/shelf with four trays in the front and four in the back\), and closing the door. This process was repeated to fill the dryer, and the lyophilization cycle was initiated post final door sealing once all trays were loaded. It was observed that the loading method impacted the rate of product collapse during the freeze-drying process. Inadvertent annealing resulting from indexing of shelves during the loading process resulted in product collapse. This is further described in greater details below, while results \(shows as percentage of vial collapsed\) is described in Table 13.

Engineering batches in the production settings were successfully executed, utilizing the fully expanded shelf configuration \(referred to as fully indexed shelves\), thereby indicating the ability to utilize the full dryer without any product impact. While transitioning to a new dryer within the same facility, an attempt was made to optimize the loading process by indexing the shelves during the loading process. This was achieved by compressing the shelves at the start of the loading process followed by the sequential raising of several shelves and loading the product on the exposed shelves. In contrast to loading on fully indexed shelves, indexing during loading resulted in a marked increase in the rate of product collapse observed resulting in an increased rejection rate \(Table 13\). A root cause investigation determined the main cause of collapse be associated with inadvertent annealing and, in certain cases, product exceeding Tg′ when shelves were indexed during the loading process. This was attributed to the fact that shelves when compressed have a lower exposed surface area and corresponding capacity to rapidly chill the cold air entering the chamber and created air circulation during indexing. In contrast, fully expanded shelves act as a heat sink to remove heat from incoming warm air due to a much larger surface area. A comparison and contrast between the CQAs \(moisture, reconstitution time, and potency\) revealed similar potency and reconstitution time between elegant and collapsed product; however, the moisture was approximately twofold higher in the collapsed product. As a remediation approach, usage of the top few shelves of the chamber was discontinued.

Understanding the process transfer between cabinets, as documented in the case study above, is therefore critical and relies on the fundamental understanding of the formulation and the process science as unwanted annealing may impact product quality. Thus, the authors recommend that proper temperature mapping studies must be performed between equipment and facilities to ensure proper and efficient technology transfer.

### **7.3 **Lyophilization Cycle for a Product in a Dual-Chamber Cartridge

Freeze-drying in dual-chamber cartridge \(DCC\) serves as one approach to improve patient compliance when coupled with a pen injector device, thereby enabling self-administration. DCC fills minimize overfill and increase dose accuracy while providing ease of reconstitution; however, the freeze-drying process itself is more complex than the vial drying process. Considerations for optimizing heat and mass flow in DCC are well documented in literature showcasing impact of process parameters on product CQAs \[16–22\]. Additionally, specifics of heat and mass transfer in dual chamber containers is described in Sect. 6.1.2. This case study here focuses on a sucrose-based formulation with a *T*c of −31 °C in a DCC with the product to be lyophilized sitting on an insulator \(rubber stopper\) 4 cm above the shelf surface. Specifically, lessons from drying the product in a DCC, which contrasts with the vial drying process, are documented here with an illustrative example of a collapsed product in DCC. It should be noted that heat transfer in such a scenario may be convection \(or radiation but not conduction\) dominated and horizontal through the sidewalls as opposed to the bottom of a vial. Furthermore, sublimation through the small diameter cartridge tip creates a flow restriction that may further complicate the drying process. Also, the edge effect may be substantially different under these conditions. Additional heat from the chamber walls that are insulated may cause cartridges at the shelf edges, particularly the corners of the top and bottom shelves, to dry significantly faster than the rest of the shelf causing lidded cakes \(initial sublimation with retention followed by a section of total collapse; a collapse within a DCC is portrayed in Fig. 6\). The product can sublime at a relatively high temperature, but shrinkage occurs as the product temperature spikes at the end of sublimation. Shrinkage with horizontal heat transfer results in an hourglass cake. Both collapse and shrinkage increase residual moisture which, in turn, may negatively impact stability especially under scenarios like the one tested here wherein the primary degradation pathway is hydrolysis.

***Fig. 6*** 
A Sample of a collapsed cake occurring in DCCs



To assure all cartridges are within the moisture specification and produce a uniform cake appearance, each cartridge must end sublimation at essentially the same product temperature. This was achieved by utilizing high heat transfer \(high shelf temperature and chamber pressure\) at the start of sublimation to warm edge cartridges quickly to optimal sublimation followed by slowing heat transfer to a minimum as the corners of the shelves end sublimation. The edge cartridges were monitored, and once edge cartridges end sublimation, all remaining cartridges were observed to be drying suboptimally. The heat transfer was then increased gradually to chase the end of sublimation from the corners to the middle of the shelves such that all cartridges end sublimation at a similar temperature to achieve an efficient drying cycle.

## **8 **Summary and Future Outlook

This paper is the second of two parts that describe best practices in the industry for lyophilization process design and validation. In the first part \(Part I: Process Design and Modeling\), recommended best practices in lyophilization process design are discussed in detail. The second part focuses on the best practices for the PPQ and CPV stages of the validation of the lyophilization process. Here, we provide a critical update to previously published literature on this topic leveraging insights from multiple biopharmaceutical companies, including guidance for equipment operational qualification, PPQ and CPV.

Specifically, best practices for batch size determination were discussed, including the impact of batch size on drying time, careful selection of process parameters to avoid product failure and to support lyophilization of the maximum batch size as a worst-case scenario. Also, batch size overage to compensate for losses during production was considered. Sampling strategies to demonstrate batch uniformity were also discussed, including sampling from worst-case locations, leveraging prior knowledge of shelf-temperature variability and relevant CQAs. The use of statistical models to ensure adequate sampling to account for variability and the probability of failing specifications are considered.

Best practices for determining the number of PPQ runs for various scenarios were presented through a survey of LyoHUB member organizations. The recommendations are centered on a bracketing approach considering maximum and minimum lyophilizer loads. Additionally, standard practice around CQA and CPP selection was outlined, and the benefits of using control charts and run charts for process trending and quality control were described, in addition to methods used to plot data in these charts. Finally, validation approaches were illustrated through case studies that covered \(i\) the validation strategy for a monoclonal antibody with two strengths lyophilized in two freeze-dryers, \(ii\) the impact of the loading process on the lyophilization cycle and product quality for a live virus vaccine, and \(iii\) the design of a lyophilization cycle for a dual chamber cartridge system.

In addition to the standard practices in the validation of the lyophilization process, special lyophilization processes and the impact thereof on the validation strategy have been discussed in this paper. Nevertheless, the knowledge and experience to scale-up of this technology for commercial manufacturing remains rudimentary. As such, development work and manufacturing experience are required to identify and characterize CPP that are specific to this technology and to select the appropriate approach to their evaluation during the manufacturing process validation campaign.

Another example of special cases is the lyophilization in alternate primary packaging systems such as dual chamber vials, syringes, and cartridges. As the number of products with such presentations is small, commercial manufacturing experience is limited. Accordingly, the validation of such lyophilization processes should take into account heat and mass transfer differences between plexiglass and aluminum holders, holder design \(“suspended” and “immersed”\), the differences between “needle-up” and “needle-down” systems, and the potential impact of siliconized stoppers on product quality and stability. In this vein, recommended best practices for alternate lyophilization container-closure systems include \(i\) the monitoring lyophilizer wall temperature to better understand edge effects, \(ii\) ensuring adequate down-time between lyophilizer sterilization and start of freeze-drying to minimize impact of shelf temperature variability, \(iii\) using shelf temperatures sufficiently lower than the product Tg′ for process homogeneity, and \(iii\) running a robustness study or engineering batch using the same process parameters, equipment, and packaging components as those intended for commercial manufacturing.

For the most part, lyophilization process scale-up and validation has been based on prior experiences and conventional scale-up factors and bracketing approaches. Over the past two decades, modeling of the primary drying phase and of the equipment capabilities has been significantly advanced. Nevertheless, most modeling efforts are still limited to the process design stage and to some extent to process scale-up and technology transfer. The potential use of modeling to guide the design of the validation protocol of the lyophilization process is still lacking. More work on the parts of the manufacturers as well regulators is required in order to formalize the use of process modeling in validation campaigns and in regulatory filings.

## Abstract

Freeze-thawing is a critical unit operation during manufacturing of biopharmaceuticals. A significant fraction of biologics drug substances are stored frozen. While the number of frozen drug products are fewer than drug substances, a frozen drug product provides a path forward in early stages of biologics development. There is increasing diversity in the modalities that are categorized as biologics and includes cells, DNA/RNA-based therapeutics, proteins, vaccines, and viruses. Several detailed commentaries are available on the fundamental characteristics of freezing, the resulting stresses, and their consequences on the stability of many modalities, chiefly, proteins. The present chapter provides an overview of the fundamental aspects of freezing and the consequences of the developing stresses on protein stability. The chapter also discusses recent advances in experimental and modeling approaches to investigate freezing-related processes and induced damage. Lastly, the commentary summarizes critical formulation and process considerations \(best practices\) in the development of biologics drug products \(mAbs and beyond\), along with the future opportunities that exist in bridging the knowledge gaps in freezing and stabilization of proteins.

## **1 ****Stresses** During **Freezing**

### **1.1 **Current Understanding of Freezing-Induced Stresses

Biologics readily undergo chemical and/or physical degradation in the solution state due to hydrolysis, deamidation, aggregation, etc. Freeze-drying technology is commonly used to improve the long-term stability of biologics drug products in the solid state and thereby alleviate the challenges encountered in commercial distribution and storage. However, the freeze-drying process itself introduces stresses on biologic \[1–3\]. Individual contributions arising from freezing stresses and their impact on protein stability have been investigated and reviewed. Briefly, the freezing step starts with ice nucleation in a supercooled solution, followed by ice crystallization, and rapid ice crystal growth until the equilibrium freezing point of the system is reached. Upon further cooling below a temperature described as the glass transition temperature of the freeze-concentrated solution, the system reaches its maximally freeze-concentrated state. The three main stresses that arise on freezing include cold denaturation, ice formation, and freeze-concentration. Proteins are shown to adsorb at the interface between the growing ice crystals and the freeze-concentrate, potentially leading to conformational changes unfavorable to protein stability. Ice nucleation temperature, cooling rate, annealing, and isothermal hold have been suggested to affect the ice crystal size \[4–7\]. The larger the ice crystal size, the lower the specific surface area and potentially lower interfacial effects. In recent years, technologies \(ControLyo® and ice fog\) were developed to control ice nucleation, where larger ice crystals facilitate faster removal of water vapor, and consequently, faster primary drying. Particularly, by synchronizing ice nucleation in all vials within a batch, inter-vial heterogeneity is reduced. When controlled ice nucleation is routinely implemented in pharmaceutical manufacturing in the near future, it will result in easier scale-up and significantly improved product uniformity.

In the freeze-concentrated state, concentration of the solutes in the formulation increases, resulting in buffer/non-buffer crystallization, liquid-liquid phase separation, changes in ionic strength, etc. Cryoprotectants including disaccharides \(e.g., sucrose and trehalose\) and polyols are commonly used to stabilize proteins against freezing-induced stresses. In one example, the stability of polyplex particles was investigated by varying the freezing conditions, including ice nucleation temperature and shelf ramp rate \[8\]. In that study, the duration from the onset of ice nucleation to when the temperature is lowered to the *T*g’ \(reaching maximum freeze-concentration\) was defined as “residence time”. Theoretically, two opposing effects are in play during this time. Extended residence time allows ice crystal to grow larger, potentially reducing adsorption-induced degradation at the ice/freeze-concentrate interface. Meanwhile, aggregation can be pronounced with increasing residence time in the freeze-concentrated state. Aggregation of the polyplex particles was found to directly relate to the residence time in the freeze-concentrated state where the viscosity remained low. In a recent study, it was demonstrated that increased residence time in the freeze-concentrated solution directly affected the aggregation of rHSA formulations \[6\]. Depending on the degradation mechanism of protein formulations during freezing, appropriate stabilization approaches can be employed by modifying freezing conditions and/or optimizing formulation composition.

### **1.2 **Recent Insights in Freezing-Induced Stresses

#### ***1.2.1 ***Dissolved Gas

During freezing, gaseous nitrogen and oxygen are present in the freeze-concentrated solution. The concentration of the dissolved gases increases due to the increase in solubility at lower temperatures \[9\]. For molecules prone to oxidation, drug product quality attributes can be negatively impacted due to an increased level of oxygen during freezing \[10,11\]. Alternatively, it was demonstrated that the solubility of the dissolved gases decreases as solute concentrates during freezing \(Fig. 1\), and consequently, air bubbles can form in the freeze-concentrate. This potentially increases the risk of protein degradation at the air/solution interfaces. The existence of air bubbles has been shown previously by optical microscopy \[12\] and small-angle neutron scattering \[13\]. In a recent study, air bubbles in the “iceberg region” were found to cause higher aggregation rate in IgG formulations \[14\].

#### ***1.2.2 ***Mechanical Stress

During freezing, the volume of the frozen solution expands due to lower density of ice than water. The built-up pressure due to volume expansion during freezing can lead to deformation of a container, changes in crystallization behavior of certain solutes, and destabilization of proteins. Previously the magnitude of pressure increase upon freezing was quantified by experiment in addition to theoretical estimation. In pharmaceutically relevant formulations, freezing-induced pressure is estimated to be approximately 1.2 MPa per degree of supercooling \[15\], corresponding to a pressure of 120–180 bar \(supercooling of 10–15 °C\). Based on theoretical estimation, while pressure-induced unfolding is often reversible, high local protein concentration in the freeze-concentrated solution would increase the probability of protein-protein interaction, which could lead to aggregation in the case of unfolded proteins. To test the hypothesis about the role of the freeze-induced pressure in protein destabilization, further experimental and computer modeling data on increase in hydrostatic pressure raise \(with spatial resolution of microns\) are needed.

In addition to hydrostatic pressure and mechanical stresses due to volume expansion, there are also stresses due to the flow of liquid during freezing \(mass flow onto ice crystal surface to support growing of ice crystals\) and thawing. Such a liquid flow would result in shear stresses, contributing to protein destabilization \[16\]. Experimental or computational approaches are needed to evaluate the impact of shear stresses during freeze-thaw in pharmaceutically relevant systems.

## **2 **Novel Modalities

### **2.1 **Vaccines

Today, vaccines are one of the most efficient ways in controlling the spread of infectious diseases. The effectiveness of vaccines is dependent on the antigen stability and can be affected by several factors as published in the available literature \[17–19\].

Live, attenuated viral vaccines, one of the most promising methods for prevention of viral diseases, are extremely unstable in aqueous solutions, and hence, most of them need to be stored either as a frozen liquid below −60 °C or at refrigerated conditions, if lyophilized. Hansen et al. \[20\] have identified intra-virus ice formation, osmolarity changes, pH shifts, and effects on the viral-coated proteins and the viral lipid membrane as some of the possible associated stresses that viruses can experience during freezing. Substantial changes in the secondary and tertiary structure of the glycoprotein haemagglutinin \(HA\) of the influenza subunit virus were observed on freezing formulations containing phosphate buffer saline \(PBS\) when compared to HEPES buffer owing to the lower pH caused due to selective precipitation of the disodium phosphate during freezing. A less pronounced acid-induced conformational change in HA was observed after rapid freezing owing to the shorter residence time spent by HA in the freeze-concentrated PBS when compared to slow freezing \[21\].

Slow freezing on the shelf and slow thawing \(at 4 °C\) was found to be detrimental to the stability of herpes simplex virus, a lipid-enveloped virus, as opposed to fast freezing by immersion in liquid nitrogen and fast thawing \(at 37 °C\) \[22\]. The effect of freezing rate on the recovery of freeze-dried herpes simplex virus 2 \(HSV2\) was also studied by Zhai et al. The fastest cooling rate using liquid propane was found to be the most detrimental to HSV2 stability followed by shelf cooling and immersion into liquid nitrogen. Quench freezing using liquid propane caused formation of very fine ice crystals and also a greater fraction of unfrozen water which probably recrystallized during warming to the primary drying temperature thus disrupting the virus and finally leading to loss of viral infectivity \[23\].

Vaccines containing aluminum salt adjuvants are sensitive to freezing, with recommendations to store at 2–8 °C. However, frequent accidental exposures to freezing \(sub-zero\) temperatures during cold chain transportation of such vaccines are very common and well documented \[24\]. While not all exposures to sub-zero temperatures \(−4 °C or warmer\) led to actual physical freezing of the vaccines, even single exposure to −10 °C of a Hepatitis B vaccine caused freezing of the vaccine formulation leading to adjuvant-antigen aggregation and reduction of immunogenicity in mice. Further, the duration of cold exposure was also observed to influence the potency of the vaccine. These results were attributed to changes in the tertiary structure of the antigen and colloidal instability caused by changes in the surface charge of the adjuvant antigen particles due to freezing \[25\].

The Covid-19 pandemic led to the development of mRNA-based frozen vaccines containing lipid nanoparticles; limited information exists in the published literature on the freeze-thaw stability of these new modalities.

### **2.2 **DNA/RNA

Lipid-like nanoparticles \(LLNs\) are extensively used for delivering mRNA both *in vitro* and *in vivo* \[26\]. Freeze-thaw stability of LLNs containing mRNA encoding for firefly luciferase improved in the presence of amorphous cryoprotectants such as 5% sucrose and trehalose whereas the inclusion of crystallizable excipients such as mannitol \(at 5% or 10%\) led to a 60% reduction in luciferase expression \[27\].

The effect of multiple freeze-thaw cycling on the stability of genomic DNA as a function of DNA concentration and DNA size was systematically investigated by Shao and coworkers. Higher DNA concentrations of 100 μg/mL appeared to stabilize the DNA against freeze-thaw related stress when compared to lower concentration of 10 μg/mL. Freeze-thaw instability was also observed to be dependent on the DNA size with sizes larger than 100 kb being most susceptible to the stresses \[28\].

The inclusion of a neutral non-reducing sugar such as sorbitol was essential in preserving the *in vitro* transfection efficiency of cationic lipid/DNA complex \(lipoplex\) in a low ionic strength buffer after freeze-thaw. Transfection efficiency of lipoplexes in only water or saline dropped to 30% after one freeze-thaw cycle \[29\].

A reduction in transfection efficiency and an increase in the particle size indicated aggregation of lipid/DNA complexes after a slow freeze-thaw cycle versus rapid freeze-thaw. This loss in transfection could be prevented in presence of sucrose. Two mechanisms for cryoprotection were proposed: \(a\) sugars interacting directly with the polar moieties of lipids thereby preventing membrane fusion and \(b\) a colligative effect of the sugar molecules reducing the ice formation and subsequent cryo-concentration of the lipoplexes which promote aggregation \[30\].

### **2.3 **Gene Therapy

Gene therapy is one of the most widely explored newer modalities today. Three products, namely, Glybera, IMLYGIC, and Luxturna, are commercially available as frozen drug products. Irrespective of whether viral or non-viral vectors are used, the success of gene therapy really depends on efficient, reliable, and safe delivery of the genetic material to the target cells \(transduction\). The physical and chemical stability of the vector plays a very important role in achieving transduction of the genetic material into the target cell.

A phosphate buffer-based formulation \(pH 7.4\) was investigated for viruses and adeno-associated viral vectors \(AAV\) \[31, 32\]. Stability of the AAV and adenoviral formulations was observed to be dependent on the pH of the frozen solution in comparison to the initial pH. While adenoviral formulations experienced one log loss in titer with a pH drop of 4 units, AAV formulations were found to be less sensitive to the pH drop with a titer loss of 0.5 log \[31\]. Wright et al. \[32\] also observed similar effects of freeze-thawing on AAV2 stability even after just a single freeze-thaw cycle.

More recently, a 50–75% decrease in capsid titer was observed for a recombinant AAV2 drug product formulated in phosphate buffer with a slow thawing rate as compared to a fast thaw using a scale-down model \[33\]. No effect of the freezing rates was observed. These observations from a scale-down model might not be representative of the at-scale freeze-thaw process. In such cases, a scale-down model that is representative of at-scale freeze-thaw rates is critical for thorough analysis. When Tris buffer was used instead of phosphate for the freeze-thawing experiments, the capsid titers were observed to be consistent after freeze-thaw studies.

### **2.4 **Cells

Cryopreservation of cells is an extensively researched topic. The available literature describes that the freezing injury to the cells can be a consequence of either direct mechanical injury due to formation of intracellular ice crystals or indirect damages due to alterations in the composition of the liquid phase internal and external to the cell \[34\]. The nucleation of ice and crystal growth is determined by the cooling rate which affects ice formation internally or externally to the cell. Mazur explained that at slower cooling rates, the water surrounding the cell freezes, while the internal water remains unfrozen due to the cell membrane acting as a barrier. As the external solutes concentrate, there is sufficient time for the internal unfrozen water to exit the cells in favor of the chemical gradient leading to cell shrinkage. Alternatively, at faster cooling rates there is insufficient time for the water to cross across the membrane. Therefore higher amounts of supercooled water remain internalized in the cell which freezes on further cooling. Intracellular freezing causes cell death. For every cell type, an optimum balance between solute concentration and extracellular ice effects needs to be established \[38\].

Lovelock emphasized that the extent of hemolysis after freezing erythrocytes was dependent on the extent of cryoconcentration of sodium chloride during freezing \[35\]. Apart from the ice crystallization, eutectic crystallization of the other solutes in the cells such as sodium chloride has also been observed to be detrimental to cells. Post-thaw viability of AT-1 rat prostate tumor cells was assessed by Han et al. \[36\], and freezing injury mechanisms associated with eutectic crystallization of solutes in the cell vicinity were reported. Cell injury was atrributed to either mechanical effects of eutectic crystallization on the cell membrane or intracellular ice-crystallization mechanisms. Further differences in the extent of cell injury depending on the cell concentration and cooling and thawing rates were reported. Pegg et al. \[37\] observed that a hemolysis of a suspension of red blood cells in 2.5 M glycerol was strongly dependent on the hematocrit value when it exceeded 50%. The effectiveness of glycerol as a cryoprotectant increased with concentration at the higher hematocrit values. At 2 M glycerol concentration, hemolysis was observed to be inversely proportional to thawing rate when cooling rate was less than 1000 °C/min and directly dependent on cooling rates at higher cooling rates.

## **3 **Advances in Modeling Approaches

The development of biopharmaceuticals has traditionally relied on a series of systematical biochemical and biophysical characterization studies that seek to quantify the stability behavior of the drug substance/product \(DS/DP\) across the different manufacturing unit operations as well as over shelf-life storage. In general, these methodologies are result of decades of industry and academic research on formulation and process development that led to the development of platform formulations for well-established modalities such as monoclonal antibodies \(mAbs\) \[38–40\].

While developing a DP based on platform modalities is already an expensive and high-risk enterprise that requires hundreds of lab-, pilot-, and large-scale experiments for product and process characterization, it becomes even more challenging for novel modalities such as nanoparticles, RNA-, and gene-based therapies. This scenario is accompanied by a dynamic evolution of the biopharmaceutical field that pursues to deliver breakthrough medicines faster to patients \[41, 42\]. In this context, *in-silico* models can help accelerate the development process by minimizing the need for laborious and empirical experimental efforts, e.g., design of experiments \(DOE\) factorial studies. These models aim to elucidate the underlying nature of a process or system and enable optimal equipment design, manufacturing process development, scale-up, and tech transfer, thereby resulting in significant savings in time, cost, and material needs throughout the DP development lifecycle.

*In-silico* models can be classified according to the framework utilized to correlate the independent \(input\) and dependent \(output\) variables of the system under consideration. Models that are based on first-principles \(*ab-initio*\) or phenomenological equations are also known as white box models. Molecular dynamics \(MD\) \[43, 44\], computational fluid dynamics \(CFD\) \[45\], and thermo-kinetic reaction engineering approaches \(REA\) \[46\] are examples of this class of models that have been employed to describe freezing and thawing. Conversely, in black box models, the mechanistic details of the system are neglected \(or unknown\) and purely mathematical relationships between inputs and outputs are utilized to describe the problem. Examples of such data-driven models include linear regression and complex machine-learning techniques \[47\]. The vast majority of freeze-thawing models with engineering relevance are a combination of physics-based models, mainly based on canonical heat and mass transfer equations, with input parameters obtained from experiments, e.g., by data interpolation, and can be referred to as grey box models.

As freezing and thawing are present in a broad range of practical applications, there is extensive literature on such physical processes \[48\]. Therefore, discussing the details of every previous modeling-based study with relevance to freezing and thawing of biopharmaceuticals is beyond the scope of this section. Instead, the present objective is to provide a glimpse of the different techniques and related problems that have been recently explored by the scientific community. Table 1 summarizes these efforts in terms of the product or process attributes of main interest and respective modeling framework.

Considering that experiments and modeling are complementary techniques, Table 2 is intended to serve as an additional source for scientists seeking to refine their experimental best practices \[9, 49\] and utilize independent experimental data to validate freezing and thawing models.

It is clear from this brief and contemporaneous literature survey that a combination of multiple modeling and experimental techniques are necessary to describe the multiscale and coupled biophysical processes that take place during freeze-thaw of pharmaceuticals. The evolution of solute and temperature gradients within the freezing \(or thawing\) matrix, in general, are accurately predicted by existing heat and mass transfer models. However, there is no established, universal modeling framework to predict the *in-situ* evolution of biochemical critical quality attributes \(CQAs\). Given the complexity and molecular nature of the associated mechanisms, most efforts on this topic take a pragmatic case-by-case approach in which the measurable product and process parameters – such as cooling rate, temperature, solute concentration, and pH distributions – are directly correlated to the CQAs of interest \(e.g., aggregation and loss of potency\). In summary, while significant progress has been made on the modeling front, there is still a long road towards the point where computational models will be able to fully describe and, most importantly, predict how biochemical CQAs are impacted by representative freeze-thawing processes.

## **4 **Concluding Remarks

One critical aspect of frozen biological drug products is defining the storage and shipping condition and allowable excursions. Typically, it is recommended that frozen drug products are stored at a temperature below the glass transition temperature of the freeze-concentrate. However, in certain cases, drug products are stored above the glass transition temperature as long as product quality attributes are deemed unimpacted over long-term storage. For formulations containing excipients with a propensity to crystallize in the frozen state \(e.g., sorbitol and trehalose\), it is recommended to store and ship such formulations at temperatures where crystallization is not observed. Time out of storage studies and freeze-thaw cycling needs to be evaluated in development to inform allowable excursion and handle deviations during handling \[80–82\].

The importance of the freezing step in quality attributes of biologics has been extensively reviewed in the literature. Beyond the widely accepted current understanding of freezing-induced degradation of biologics, this book chapter highlights recent insights in stresses that biologics formulation experience during freezing, emerging modeling approaches for the freezing step and stabilization of novel modalities including cell and gene therapies. In particular, stresses from dissolved gas during freezing and mechanical stress from ice crystal have been discovered at least theoretically in recent years. The stresses observed during freezing of the novel modalities such as vaccines, DNA/RNA, viral vectors, or cells remain more or less the same and primarily governed by ice nucleation event and the freezing rates there on. Further experimental and computational work are required to fully understand the impact of these stress factors on quality attributes of biologics.

There are several other critical unit operations in biopharma manufacturing that can also benefit from modeling approaches. With the fast evolution of computers, problems that were intractable from a CPU-time perspective are becoming accessible and, therefore, the opportunities for practical applications of *in-silico* models will keep growing. As intrinsic part of the current industrial revolution wave \(Industry 4.0\), terms such as digital twins, big data, artificial intelligence \(AI\), and machine learning \(ML\) are already a reality in different arms of the biopharma field. FDA and ASME have also recognized the importance of computational predictive tools and established modeling & simulation working groups for evaluation and regulatory guidance \[83, 84\]. Having that in mind, our industry should continuously expand and implement modeling expertise by building and enhancing predictive tools that can significantly accelerate process development and tech transfer.

## **1 **Introduction

Pharmaceutical product stability can often be improved by removing water or other solvents in a controlled manner through the process referred to as lyophilization or freeze-drying \[1\]. Lyophilization serves as one of the most widely used techniques for manufacturing solid biopharmaceuticals, including but not limited to biologics \[2\] and vaccines \[3\], to achieve the intended shelf-life of the product during storage and shipping. Such improvement in stability enhancement is attributed to limited hydrolytic reactions coupled with restricted mobility and/or conformational flexibility of the active molecule in presence of excipients. The pharmaceutical lyophilization involves three main steps \[4\]: \(1\) freezing of the product which is initially in a solution to produce a matrix of ice and other crystallizable excipients while concentrating other solutes and the active pharmaceutical ingredient \(API\) within the interstitial voids; \(2\) primary drying, wherein ice is sublimed at low-temperature, vacuum conditions; and \(3\) secondary drying to remove unfrozen water, which may be adsorbed on the surface of the crystalline phase or is in the solute phase, carried out at temperatures well above that in the primary drying. The equipment and the processes are designed to ensure product sterility is maintained during the process of lyophilization. Furthermore, during the early stages of product development \(pre-pivotal studies\), there is a great emphasis on process design space as it allows for process understanding, process monitoring, and product characterization while establishing a rational line of sight to commercial manufacturing.

The lyophilization process design, therefore, is a critical aspect of manufacturing process development for a lyophilized pharmaceutical product. A well-understood process can be scaled up and controlled, resulting in consistent quality attributes across product batches, which can be demonstrated by validation. Commercial product launch requires that the lyophilization process is successfully validated per country-specific regulatory expectations. This is especially important when there are changes to the product or process such as different dosage strengths or lyophilizer equipment. A critical understanding of the factors affecting the product quality associated with a lyophilization process can enable such changes to be carried out using fewer engineering runs. This can often be further supported by leveraging models to predict heat and mass transfer in various scenarios.

This work is the first of a two-part paper describing the current state of lyophilization validation. Part I will focus on process design, while Part II will discuss process qualification and continued process verification. Also, both articles will provide the authors’ perspectives on best practices for lyophilization validation as well as the use of modeling to support comprehensive and efficient validation. The intent of these articles is to provide readers with recent updates on lyophilization validation, supplementing past publications by Jennings in 1986 \[5\] and Trappler in 2007 \[6\]. Ever since the publication of the latter report, several advances have been attained in lyophilization technologies, process analytical technology \(PAT\), computer modeling and simulation tools for lyophilization process, and equipment capability. Accordingly, an update of the best practices of the validation of lyophilization processes is needed especially given the surge in the number of therapeutic modalities in development pipelines that require lyophilization. This work is our community-combined opinion and industrial prospective on the lyophilization validation process.

Part I of this best practices publication focuses on the early lyophilization process design with an emphasis on the generation of a design space for a given product and equipment combination. In addition, strategies for engineering runs during commercial scale-up are proposed, including considerations for lyophilization cycle design and optimization and equipment capability. The benefits of modeling as applied to process design and scale-up are also discussed and illustrated through case studies, addressing challenges such as multiple vial sizes, fill volumes, and dosage strengths. Product formulation and container closure systems, while related to lyophilization, are described in limited detail to the extent that they are relevant to process design and scale-up. New and upcoming approaches to process improvement \(e.g., controlled ice nucleation or CIN\), product monitoring, and process understanding \(e.g., tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy or TDLAS and process analytical technology or PAT\) are also listed below with an emphasis on chemistry, manufacturing, and controls \(CMC\) requirements associated with manufacturing a safe, effective, and quality products.

## **2 **Lyophilization Process Validation

Process validation is generally defined as “the collection, documentation, and evaluation of data from the early development stages through commercial production to establish a manufacturing process that is capable of consistently delivering a quality product” \[7\]. In this regard, process validation involves a series of product and process development activities as well as manufacturing operations and is classified into three main stages: process design, process qualification, and continued process verification. As part of the validation process, the drug product to be lyophilized must be well-defined and documented for its physical, chemical, and pharmaceutical properties, and all aspects of finished product such as moisture, sterility, dose uniformity, stability, etc. must be captured. Best practices and guidance on process design are captured below with an emphasis on the unit operation of freeze-drying only.

### **2.1 **Stage 1: Process Design

The main goals of the process design stage are \(1\) to build and capture process knowledge and understanding and \(2\) to establish a strategy for process control \[7\]. The commercial manufacturing process is defined during this stage based on knowledge gained through developmental experiments and scale-up activities. The process design experiments do not need to be performed under good manufacturing practice \(GMP\) conditions but must be based on scientifically sound methods and should be adequately documented and verified \[7\].

Building and capturing process knowledge and understanding requires that all relevant data obtained during drug product, and process development activities are collected and documented. At this stage, process design should consider the functionality and limitations of commercial manufacturing equipment due to geometry and design, scale effects, the variability of component lots, environmental conditions, and measurement systems. Typically, risk analysis tools such as failure modes and effects analysis \(FMEA\) or cause and effect analysis can be used to evaluate critical variables that can potentially impact process performance and product quality and to guide the design of the studies required to build sufficient process understanding \[8\]. It should be noted that any change in either the equipment, facility, process itself, or even the test method should be well-evaluated to identify and document the rationale and/or need for revalidation or requalification. Computational models and simulations based on first principles can also help the design of the experimental studies by establishing the relevant process parameter ranges to be tested and in many cases, may eliminate the need for a design of experiments \(DoE\) based on statistical approach, thereby simplifying the change management process.

Based on the process knowledge and understanding obtained from laboratory- and pilot-scale experiments, a strategy for process control is established to ensure the consistency of product quality, typically by reducing and/or adjusting for input variation during manufacturing. In the lyophilization process design, a design space diagram is usually constructed to determine the safe operating zone for critical process parameters. Process control typically involves monitoring critical equipment and process parameters and may involve process analytical technologies \(PAT\) to enable adjusting the processing conditions to maintain critical parameters within target limits. The control strategy, in general, may include process parameters and critical quality attributes \(CQAs\) related to the drug product, raw materials, and excipients; facility; operating conditions of the lyophilize; in-process checks \(IPC\); product specification along with testing approach; and frequency of monitoring and control \(Annex I\). Closed-loop control of primary drying for process acceleration and utilization of control ice nucleation \(CIN \), for example, has been a key area of discussion the community to attain faster and uniform drying and minimize/eliminate failure during scale-up process. These emerging topics and their impact on process design would also be discussed in subsequent sections below.

### **2.2 **Stage 2: Process Qualification

The goal of the process qualification \(PQ\) stage is to determine if the process designed in Stage 1 is reproducible for commercial manufacture, and as such activities in this stage should apply cGMP-compliant procedures. Stage 2 involves qualification of the facility, equipment, and utilities as well as process performance qualification \(PPQ\). Further details on Stage 2 as applied to lyophilization validation are well documented in Part II of the best practices paper. It should be noted, however, that the goal of process validation here is to demonstrate that the lyophilization process leads to the desired product characteristics and quality under all load conditions \(i.e., bracketing the minimum and maximum load\), and thus a few different case studies demonstrating the power of simple modeling to accommodate process and product changes are highlighted in Sect. 4.

### **2.3 **Stage 3: Continued Process Verification

The goal of Stage 3 is to ensure that the process remains in a state of control, that is, it consistently assures the continued process performance and product quality \[7\]. Thus, as part of continued verification, process monitoring data are needed to evaluate if the drying process performs as documented, including the performance of CPPs \(critical process parameters\) within tolerance limit, and thus the value of in-process analytics \(e.g., moisture, potency\) and in-line PAT \(e.g., TDLAS\) cannot be overstated. Further details on continued process verification for pharmaceutical lyophilization are given in Part 2 of this best practices paper.

## **3 **Stage 1: Process Design

### **3.1 **Generation and Use of Design Space

#### ***3.1.1 ***Introduction to the Driving Forces and Resistances During Primary Drying

The primary drying step in a lyophilization process is conducted to remove bulk ice from the frozen solution. This is accomplished by tuning shelf temperature and chamber pressure to achieve sublimation while controlling the product temperature. The product temperature is critical during the process, but it cannot be controlled directly. It should be noted that pre-lyo formulations are characterized by their glass transition \(*T*g′\), eutectic temperature \(*T*eu\), and collapse temperature \(*T*c\); the product temperature is monitored using a thermocouple; however, the drying operation itself is a time-/temperature-/pressure-driven process. It is desirable to operate at a product temperature as high as possible without causing failure of the product. The failure is defined as the loss of structural integrity of the drying solid that often results from exceeding a critical product temperature. Thus, properties of the final formulated product such as *T*c/*T*eu are rendered critical and are well-characterized before starting the drying process. Operating at a product temperature that is as high as possible is desired because the driving force during primary drying is the difference in the vapor pressure of ice between the sublimation front and the chamber pressure. The temperature in the condenser is typically less than approximately −60 °C, and the temperature at the sublimation front is typically much higher. For example, the vapor pressure of ice at −60 °C is approximately 8.1 mTorr, and the vapor pressure of ice at the sublimation front at a temperature of −20 °C is approximately 774.4 mTorr. The large pressure difference establishes a flow of water vapor from the area of high-vapor pressure to the area of low-vapor pressure, making it advantageous to perform at the highest product temperature possible, creating the most efficient process. Resistance to heat and mass transfer in this dynamic process renders controlling product temperature constant as drying progresses a challenging task. This is further described briefly below.

The resistance to heat transfer originates from the materials through which the heat must travel to reach the product. These materials include the fluid flowing through the shelves, the stainless steel shelves, the primary packaging in contact with the shelves, and the air space between the bottom of the primary packaging and the shelves. The heat transfer coefficient of the primary container \(*K*v\) differs from container to container and is dependent on the chamber pressure. The heat transfer coefficient represents the ratio of the heat flow from shelves to the product in a given vial, the outer cross-sectional area of the vial, and the temperature difference between the shelf surface and the product at the bottom of the vial \[9\]. Therefore, it is important to measure the *K*v for the specific primary packaging container and chamber pressure; if the type and/or manufacturer of the packaging changes, *K*v needs to be measured again. Additionally, since the free molecular heat conductivity changes with pressure, the value of the apparent *K*v also changes as a function of pressure \[9\].

There is also resistance to the mass transfer of water vapor through the drying product \(*R*p\). The water vapor must travel from the sublimation front via the pores of the dried layer and through the gap between the container and container closure to reach the chamber. The factors that affect *R*p are the degree of supercooling before ice nucleation, the physical nature of the solids, the solids content, and the location of the sublimation front within the drying solid \[10\]. For example, solutions that undergo a high degree of supercooling will reach low product temperatures before ice nucleation. It should be noted that product resistance can be affected by annealing conditions and fill height \[11\]. The ice nucleation temperature affects the time available for the crystallization of ice. Solutions that have less time for ice crystal growth will have small pores in the drying solid, and this increases the *R*p. Similarly, high concentrations of solids will also have narrow pores through which water vapor must travel. Finally, *R*p is lowest at the onset of drying and increases as the sublimation front travels to the bottom of the solid during drying. The *R*p value ultimately used for drying solids is often based on the worst-case scenario when the sublimation front reaches the bottom of the drying solid.

#### ***3.1.2 ***Equations for the First Principles of Heat and Mass Transfer

Data for the *K*v of the vials and *R*p of the product can be collected during the cycle and used in heat and mass transfer equations to create a design space graph for primary drying. *K*v is calculated using the following system of ordinary differential equations: 



![$$ \frac{dq}{dt}={K}_{\mathrm{v}}{A}_{\mathrm{v}}\left({T}_{\mathrm{s}}-{T}_{\mathrm{b}}\right) $$](images/000002.jpeg)


\(1\)





![$$ \frac{dq}{dt}=\Delta {H}_{\mathrm{s}}\frac{dm}{dt} $$](images/000003.jpeg)


\(2\)


where  ![$$ \frac{dq}{dt} $$](images/000004.jpeg)  is the heat transfer rate in Joule·hr−1, *K*v is the vial heat transfer coefficient in Joule·hr−1·cm−2·°C−1, Av is the outer area of the vial in cm2, *T*s is the temperature of the shelf surface in °C, *T*b is the temperature of the product in contact with the bottom of the vial in °C,  ![$$ \frac{dm}{dt} $$](images/000005.jpeg)  is the mass flow rate in g·hr−1, and Δ*H*s is the heat of sublimation of ice in Joule·g−1 \[9\]. The equations are rearranged based on the data that are available to the following: 



![$$ \Delta {H}_{\mathrm{s}}\frac{dm}{dt}={K}_{\mathrm{v}}{A}_{\mathrm{v}}\left({T}_{\mathrm{s}}-{T}_{\mathrm{b}}\right) $$](images/000006.jpeg)


\(3\)





![$$ {K}_{\mathrm{v}}=\frac{\Delta {H}_{\mathrm{s}}\frac{dm}{dt}}{A_{\mathrm{v}}\left({T}_{\mathrm{s}}-{T}_{\mathrm{b}}\right)} $$](images/000007.jpeg)


\(4\)




The vial heat transfer coefficient *K*v changes as a function of pressure due to the significant influence of gas conduction at the typical pressures encountered in pharmaceutical freeze-drying \[12\]. *K*v is often characterized using a tray of the specific vial or other primary packaging container filled approximately half full of water. The water is frozen, and a vacuum is initiated as the shelf temperature is adjusted to the shelf temperature planned for use with the product. As shown in Eq. \(4\), the mass flow rate \(or rate of ice loss\), shelf, and product temperatures are needed to calculate *K*v.

The rate of ice loss is calculated either gravimetrically or by measuring the in-process mass flow of water vapor at multiple increments of chamber pressure using tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy \(TDLAS\) \[13\]. For example, a tray of vials can be equipped with type-T thermocouples that are placed in vials located at the center, front, and back of the tray. TDLAS is a mass flow meter that is located in the duct that connects the product chamber with the condenser. The instrument uses two lasers and two detectors to measure the concentration and flow rate of water vapor traveling to the condenser. The data are used in the first principles of heat and mass transfer equations to calculate *K*v and *R*p \[14\]. Referring back to the tray of vials as per the example, the tray is transferred to the shelf of a lyophilizer and the vials are frozen to −45 °C. When using TDLAS, an operational check is performed for zero-velocity offset, and then primary drying is conducted at a shelf temperature specific to the product. The chamber pressure is set at 50 mTorr and the sublimation rate is monitored by TDLAS. The shelf is held at the set chamber pressure until a steady-state is reached. The chamber pressure set point is increased to 75 mTorr, 100 mTorr, 125 mTorr, 150 mTorr, 175 mTorr, and 200 mTorr, allowing sublimation to reach an equilibrium at each set point. A representative plot of the process data is provided in Fig. 1.

Approaches to obtaining information on *K*v varies across industry. Some approaches use a batch average value for *K*v \(e.g., by using TDLAS\) to develop a design space, while other methods determine the *K*v based on the location of the container on the shelf and between shelves by relying on gravimetric approaches. The end goal with these characterizations is to understand what influences *K*v and to use a consistent approach for the development of the design space. Irrespective of the approach used, an analysis of Eq. \(4\) reveals that *K*v can be obtained by measuring the normalized mass flow rate and the temperature differential between product \(*T*b\) and shelf \(*T*s\). To measure *T*b, it is recommended that the thermocouples should be placed at the bottom of the vial. As the sublimation front approaches the bottom, the measured temperature closely approaches the temperature of the sublimation front. The vapor pressure, *P*i, is then calculated by using a least-squares fit of the data. This yields an equation relating vapor pressure and product temperature in the form \[15\] 



![$$ {P}_{\mathrm{i}}=\exp\ \left[\frac{A}{T_{\mathrm{b}}}+B\right] $$](images/000009.jpeg)


\(5\)


where *T*b is the temperature at the bottom of the frozen layer and the values of constants *A* and *B* vary based on the range of temperatures being used. For temperatures between 169 K and 273.16 K, which are typical for lyophilization processes, *A* = − 6132.9 and *B* = 28.868 when *P*i is measured in *P*a \[15, 16\].

Similarly, the mass flow rate can be either obtained gravimetrically or using TDLAS as an in-line PAT tool. It should be noted that TDLAS is a noninvasive tool that allows concurrent measurement of the mass flow rate during the freeze-dry cycle. An illustrative example of a TDLAS profile observed during a freeze-drying cycle wherein the batch average mass flow rate is recorded as a function of time is shown in Fig. 2. 
![](images/000010.jpeg)


***Fig. 2*** 
Graph of mass flow rate of water vapor as a function of time for the batch



Using the mass flow data obtained from the TDLAS, the shelf temperature \(*T*s\), and product temperature \(*T*b\), *K*v is calculated for each chamber pressure in Joule·hr−1·cm−2·°C. A representative plot of *K*v as a function of chamber pressure is provided in Fig. 3. 
![](images/000011.jpeg)


***Fig. 3*** 
Representative plot of *K*v as a function of chamber pressure and time



Furthermore, as observed in Fig. 2, the mass flow rate decreases from about 5 to 15 h before a large decrease is observed. The sublimation rate decreases steadily during primary drying because the resistance to vapor flow increases with the depth of the partially dried layer and thus *R*p.

The product dried cake resistance, *R*p, in contrast to *K*v, is assumed to be independent of shelf temperature and chamber pressure and is a function of formulation and drying characteristics. *R*p, given in cm2·Torr·hr·g−1, is calculated using the following equation: 



![$$ {R}_{\mathrm{p}}=\frac{A_{\mathrm{p}}\left({P}_{\mathrm{i}}-{P}_{\mathrm{c}}\right)}{\frac{dm}{dt}} $$](images/000012.jpeg)


\(6\)


where *A*p is the cross-sectional area of the product \(using the inner diameter of the vial\), *P*i is the vapor pressure of ice at the sublimation front, and *P*c is the chamber pressure. Using the mass flow rate, the partial pressure of ice, and partial pressure of water vapor in the chamber, the resistance is calculated in Torr·hr·cm2·g−1. *R*p increases with time during primary drying with the maximum value of *R*p observed toward the end of primary drying \(Fig. 4\). There is a sharp increase in *R*p directly after 17 h of primary drying time. This occurs after all ice sublimes and resistance becomes a function of diffusion of unfrozen water through the drying solid. Therefore, the point of highest resistance before complete loss of ice is considered as the point of the curve just before the rapid increase in *R*p. 
![](images/000013.jpeg)


***Fig. 4*** 
*R*p as a function of time with the highest resistance observed at approximately 17 h showing an *R*p of 7 Torr·hr·cm2·g−1



*R*p and *K*v are combined with the critical product temperature for the product and the equipment capability curve to create a design space graph. The calculations are entered into an Excel® macro \(or equivalent software\) to solve the model equations and calculate the product temperature at different combinations of shelf temperature and chamber pressure. The calculations can also be conducted iteratively to create the design space graph. In general, multiple methods can be used to complete the calculations for a design space as long as they are developed based on the main equations for *R*p and *K*v presented above \[17\]. Some lyophilizers are equipped with software that allows for the determination of *R*p and *K*v in tandem, and some equipment determines *R*p and *K*v using manometric temperature measurement \[18\]. It is worth noting that the design space generated for lab-scale equipment cannot be directly applied to commercial-scale lyophilizer since the scale-up procedure needs to be performed with the parameters \(i.e., *K*v, *R*p, minimum controllable pressure\) adjusted accordingly \[19\].

#### ***3.1.3 ***Determination of Primary Drying Conditions and Construction of Design Space

The relationship between the process inputs, such as chamber pressure, shelf temperature, and the critical quality attributes can be described within a design space. The International Council for Harmonization of Registration of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use \(ICH\) guidance Q8 \(R2\) defines “design space” as “the multidimensional combination and interaction of input variables \(e.g. material attributes\) and process parameters that have been demonstrated to assure quality.” Working within the design space is not considered as a change. Movement out of the design space is considered to be a change and would normally initiate a regulatory post approval change process. “Design space is proposed by the applicant and is subject to regulatory assessment and approval.” The reader is reminded that as part of continuous process verification , controls and run charts from historical data allow for monitoring any atypical patterns/trends in process parameters and any quality attributes over time and thus assure the manufacturing process is in a state of control during the product life cycle.

There are multiple approaches used for defining the appropriate conditions for primary drying. An empirical approach is to select the critical product temperature regardless of the use of thermal characterization. The process is developed using a target product temperature, shelf temperature, and chamber pressure that provide acceptable appearance \(no loss of structural integrity\), residual moisture, and reconstitution characteristics as well as a stable and sterile product, at a laboratory-scale equipment. Subsequent cycles are conducted using shelf temperatures ±5 °C from the original shelf temperature set point and ±20 mTorr around the original chamber pressure set point to verify product and process robustness/tolerance. The space for the operation would then be within the tested shelf temperatures and chamber pressures. The challenge with this approach is that the point of failure for the product may not be known and the behavior of the formulation at low temperature may not be known. Additionally, such an approach results in a non-optimized process, thereby impacting the operational efficiency of the facility. These data are often crucial to understanding the physical behavior of the formulation and to developing a process with sufficient data to support possible future excursions during manufacturing.

A related approach is to use a statistical design of experiments. The experiments are designed by varying the processing factors such as shelf temperature and chamber pressure within a specified range. The experiments are conducted, and the effects of the factors on drying time, product appearance, and stability are examined. Using statistics in this manner does not necessarily account for the combined influence of shelf temperature and chamber pressure on product temperature. Like in the first case, it is completely feasible to select different levels of shelf temperature and chamber pressure without even affecting the product temperature. This approach can provide a false sense of security if the influence of the process parameters on product temperature is not fully understood. Besides its lack of product and process understanding, this approach also suffers from nonoptimal process parameters, thereby reducing the operational efficiency of the facility.

Both approaches described above, however, can result in a freeze-drying process that is completely acceptable. The challenge is that the studies may not be based on a thorough scientific understanding of process and product.

An improved approach that is continually being refined is the development of a primary drying design space. The design space described below is based on first principles and includes all relevant data needed to understand the product, process, and their interaction. The design space is created using data on the capability of the equipment, the *K*v for the specific vial, the *R*p for the formulation, and the critical product temperature \(to characterize failure modes\) for the product. The critical product temperature is defined through thermal analysis and failure point studies during primary drying. The two methods identify the product temperature at which failure occurs and the conditions at which they occur. It is good practice to set the target product temperature a few degrees below the critical product temperature to ensure the product temperature of the vials located on the edges of the shelves does not approach the failure point.

The product resistance *R*p and heat transfer coefficient *K*v define the governing relationship between shelf temperature, chamber pressure, and product temperature needed to achieve the maximum sublimation rate without compromising the product quality. These data are used to calculate the combinations of shelf temperature and chamber pressure that ensures that the product temperature remains below the defined critical product temperature.

The use of the design space depends on knowing the vapor removal capability of the lyophilizer. The equipment capability is defined as the maximum sublimation rate \(kg/hr\) for a given chamber pressure. The maximum sublimation rate at a given chamber pressure corresponds to the equipment limitation and in many cases represents the choked flow conditions for lyophilizers designed with a spool piece between the product chamber and the condenser \[20\]. The choked flow occurs when the flow of water vapor leaving the chamber reaches the speed of sound and flow within the spool piece is the rate-limiting factor of water vapor reaching the condenser \[21\]. If a sublimation rate exceeds the vapor removal capability of a lyophilizer at a given chamber pressure, a build-up of vapor will occur with the product chamber pressure increasing over the setpoint, reaching minimum controllable pressure *P*min. The value of *P*min as a function of the sublimation rate is often determined using ice slabs on all shelves of the lyophilizer using the lowest pressure possible for the lyophilizer. The shelf temperature is increased incrementally with pauses in between to determine equilibrium pressure at a given sublimation rate \[22, 23\]. The challenge is that such ice slab experiments are often difficult to perform once the lyophilizer is used for routine production.

There are different methods for creating a primary drying design space. One method is to construct a graph plotting the sublimation rate as a function of chamber pressure and temperature \(Fig. 5\). This method provides the conditions for the most efficient process, and all of the conditions that ensure that product temperature remains below the critical product temperature, but the graph does not include how processing time is affected by the conditions. Processing time may also increase when transferring the process to an aseptic environment where higher degrees of supercooling can be expected due to the clean environment. 
![](images/000014.jpeg)


***Fig. 5*** 
Example of a primary drying design space graph showing sublimation rates as a function of pressure and temperature. Green area is the safe zone of operation. The red traces are the calculated product temperature isotherms. The solid red trace is the experimental critical product temperature. The black traces are the calculated shelf temperature isotherms. The equipment capability is represented by the solid blue line



A conservative approach is used to create the design space by decreasing the critical product temperature to account for the warmer temperatures experienced by edge vials. This should prevent encountering product failure if the process conditions align with the equipment capability and/or critical product temperature borders. It is good practice to challenge the borders of the design space to determine the likelihood of product failure and choked flow of the equipment and to examine the effect of the processing conditions on primary drying time.

The design space featured in Fig. 5 does not include primary drying time within the graph. It depends on knowing the effect of the process conditions on the primary drying time. This data can be obtained by testing the boundaries of the design space which also confirms the applicability of the design. Primary drying time may be longer when the process is transferred to full-scale manufacturing. This is typically tested using a demonstration batch to confirm the cycle.

Fundamentally the same information presented in Fig. 5 can also be visualized using time within the graph \(Fig. 6\). Incorporating time as a function of shelf temperature and chamber pressure allows for the prediction of total primary drying time for a particular product within the safe zone of operation. The safe zone of operation is between the borders for critical temperature and the minimum controllable pressure \(choke point\). 
![](images/000015.jpeg)


***Fig. 6*** 
Graph for primary drying design space that incorporates time as a function of chamber pressure and shelf temperature. The area under the critical temperature border and minimum controllable pressure border shows the safe zone of operation where the drying time increases with higher shelf temperature



Both graphs featured in Figs. 5 and 6 are flexible about changing vial types, even from different manufacturers, if needed. A change in vial requires only the determination of the *K*v for the vial and incorporating the data in the existing graph if the fill volume does not drastically change as *R*p is a function of fill volume.

The first design space graph in Fig. 5 assumes the worst-case *R*p for the drying solid which occurs near the end of drying when ice is at the bottom of the drying solid. The second design space graph simulates the process for each process parameter combination. The latter approach provides the changes in *R*p with respect to the location of the sublimation front in the drying solid. *R*p will be lowest at the start of drying and increases as the sublimation front lowers in the drying solid. This suggests that shelf temperature and chamber pressure can be adjusted throughout the process based on the *R*p. For example, more aggressive conditions can be used at the beginning of the process when *R*p is low. Also, different processing conditions within the design space can result in different *R*p values for some formulations. Particularly, *R*p can be affected by only freezing conditions during a lyo process \[24\]. Primary drying should not have any impact on *R*p unless there is any loss in structure due to collapse or meltback. The change in *R*p within the safe zone suggests that it is good practice to test the boundaries of the design space to confirm that the physical properties of the solids are acceptable.

### **3.2 **Engineering/Development Runs at Commercial Scale

It is a standard practice within the industry to perform commercial-scale runs testing the lyophilization process before moving forward with process performance qualification \(PPQ\) runs. At scale runs are not a cGMP requirement but are completed to minimize risk before proceeding to PPQ. Depending on the company, these runs may be referred to as engineering, development, or demonstration runs, but in all cases, the lyophilization process, along with other unit operations in the formulation, filling, and inspection, is being tested to identify any unexpected changes that might occur during the transfer from small scale runs or in tech transfer to a new site.

Several different product filling strategies have been embraced by the industry for the completion of engineering runs. If possible a surrogate or a placebo, formulations without the API, is used during development to minimize API requirements. A placebo is the drug product formulation without any API, typically excipients and water for injection. The removal of the API can lead to different drying behavior for the remaining solution, and therefore may not be fully representative of the drug product formulation. In a surrogate, the API is replaced with a material substitute, such as human serum albumin or Dextran-60 for a therapeutic protein, in order to provide similar solution concentrations and thermal behavior for the lyophilization process. Another option to minimize API requirements while collecting data on the active drug product is to first fill the lyophilizer with a surrogate and then replace surrogate vials with active vials at all locations where analytical testing would be performed. The number of engineering runs to be completed can vary based upon knowledge of the product formulation, lyophilization process, and equipment being used. Amongst the LyoHub \(Advanced Lyophilization Technology Hub, \[25\]\) member companies, however, a single successful engineering run is the goal of technical transfers for a given dose. If there are multiple-dose presentations for the same formulation, the engineering run strategy may be further minimized using a bracketing approach to reduce the amount of formulated drug product used within the studies.

The engineering run can provide a wealth of information as part of the process evaluation and should be completed in a manner as close to the PPQ runs as possible while allowing appropriate time for analysis of data generated during the run. Goals from the run should be to confirm that product temperature performance is within the acceptable limit, to perform a visual inspection of vials by location, and to determine the total primary drying time at scale. A sampling of the run generally follows the five locations per shelf, which are the front, back, center, left, and right sides of the lyophilizer, with a focus on appearance, residual moisture, reconstitution time, and any other product-specific attributes of interest. Visual inspection of the lot is also completed to assure uniform cake appearance for the batch. Based upon the evaluation of the engineering run data, a decision to move forward with the PPQ batches for a product is made.

## **4 **Power of Simple Modeling for Process Optimization and Scale-Up

There are several benefits of applying modeling described in Sect. 3.1 to the lyophilization process that helps both industry and the patient besides gaining a better understanding of the process. By applying and implementing the modeling, one can reduce the number of experiments during the development that would free up resources and material requirements and in limited cases may also result in a reduction in the cost of goods manufactured \(COGM\). By reducing the number of experiments, the development time can be reduced enabling faster availability of medicine to patients with life-threatening diseases. Additionally, modeling helps to better understand and design a robust process enabling the availability of a safe and high-quality drug to the patients.

The lyophilization processes can be modeled based on the fundamental understanding of heat and mass transfer given in Sect. 3.1. At steady state, when heat input is equal to output, the heat transfer rate due to shelf heating and sublimation cooling rate can be equated, and the unknowns can be determined using the following equation \[26\]: 



![$$ \left[\ {T}_{\mathrm{p}\mathrm{r}},\frac{dm}{dt},{t}_{\mathrm{PriDry}}\ \right]=f\left(\ {T}_{\mathrm{sh}},{P}_{\mathrm{ch}},{K}_{\mathrm{v}}\left({P}_{\mathrm{ch}}\right),{A}_{\mathrm{v}},{l}_{\mathrm{p}\mathrm{r},0},{R}_{\mathrm{p}},{c}_{\mathrm{solid}}\right) $$](images/000016.jpeg)


\(7\)


where  ![$$ {l}_{\mathrm{p}\mathrm{r},0}=\frac{V_{\mathrm{fill}}}{A_{\mathrm{p}}} $$](images/000017.jpeg) .

### **4.1 **Development and Optimization of a Lyophilization Process

Historically, a lyophilization process is developed by trial and error methods where, for a given collapse temperature of a formulation, experiments are performed with various shelf temperature and chamber pressure values until the output parameters, product temperature and product quality, at the end of freezing and drying phases match with the target product temperature and product quality attributes. This requires several experiments to be run and consumes a lot of resources, time, and material. However, with the use/application of modeling one can use key inputs to estimate output process parameters as outlined in Fig. 7. These parameters must be obtained on a specific lyophilizer for the target product so that the model based on these inputs are representative of the actual lyophilization process at that specific lyophilizer. 
![](images/000018.jpeg)


***Fig. 7*** 
Lyophilization model inputs and outputs



The quasi-steady one-dimensional \(1D\) heat and mass transfer model described in Sect. 3.1 is usually referred to as the “lyo-calculator” and is illustrated below in the top portion of Fig. 8. There are two important ways of using the steady-state mathematical models or two models as illustrated in Fig. 8d–f: 

1.

If one knows *K*v and *R*p, one can calculate the unknown outputs \(forward use\)⁠—the standard use of a Lyo-calculator \[9\].




2.

If one does not know *R*p \(or *K*v\) to begin with but has the experimental cycle output, then one can analyze the unknown *R*p \(or *K*v\) by fitting \(backward use\) \[19, 27\].

The overall *K*v is computed ab initio as the sum of the solid contact, gas conduction, and radiative heat transfer components



For a given collapse temperature, the predicted critical output process parameters can be confirmed with a minimal number of experiments as illustrated in Fig. 8.

### **4.2 **Scale-Up and Transfer

Another opportunity to use/apply modeling is during scale-up and tech transfer to manufacturing between lyophilizers. In the subsequent discussions, two lab-scale lyophilizers, named as LabLyo1 and LabLyo2, and two pilot-scale lyophilizers, PilotLyo1 and PilotLyo2, will be used as examples.

During scale-up and tech transfer to manufacturing, differences in heat transfer \(*K*v\) and mass transfer \(including choke flow limit\) and product resistance \(*R*p\) arising from differences in scale, design, and geometry of the freeze-dryer, product and environment \(*T*n, class 100/particle-free environment\) of the dryer need to be considered.

#### ***4.2.1 ***Class 100/Particle-Free Environment \(***T******n***\)

A key factor that needs to be considered during transfer to manufacturing is the environment. The particle-free environment in manufacturing affects the nucleation temperature which affects the morphology of ice. This in turn affects the product resistance \(*R*p\), affecting the drying rate or mass transfer rate. Product resistance for an amorphous formulation product as a function of nucleation temperature was determined and plotted as illustrated below in Fig. 9a using the quasi steady-state model as described above. The *R*p of the given formulation for a manufacturing environment where the nucleation temperature is typically approximately −23 °C was estimated from the curve. The specific surface area obtained from Brunauer-Emmett-Teller \(BET\) analysis can be further measured for each nucleation temperature case, which was found to linearly correlate with *R*p by Rambhatla et al. \[28\]. As per Fig. 9b, it was found that for a given product run on different lyophilizers in different environments, the lower environment particle level in GMP conditions leads to lower ice nucleation temperature and therefore higher *R*p. 
![](images/000020.jpeg)


***Fig. 9*** 
Effect of nucleation temperature and environment differences \(particle-free/class 100 area\) on mass transfer differences \(*R*p\)



#### ***4.2.2 ***Equipment Capability \(Minimum Controllable Chamber Pressure as a Function of Sublimation Rate\)

Typically, as part of the characterization of the freeze dryer, the equipment capability—the safety boundary without losing control of the chamber pressure—is assessed/determined through ice slab experiments \[19\] shown in Fig. 10a, which involve several experiments where the shelf temperature and chamber pressure are raised incrementally. The sublimation rate and the stable chamber pressure achieved are recorded and are plotted to determine the minimum controllable chamber pressure by the equipment at a given sublimation rate. 
![](images/000021.jpeg)


***Fig. 10*** 
Equipment capabilities for various lyophilizers determined through ice slab experiments and CFD modeling. \(**a**\) Ice slab experiments and process data. \(**b**\) CFD-modeled equipment capability and flow field of pressure



This is a cumbersome exercise and consumes significant time on the manufacturing line. Using computational fluid dynamics \(CFD\), the equipment capability can be easily estimated/predicted through simulations \[19, 20\] as illustrated below in Fig. 10b. Through CFD modeling, one also gains a deeper understanding of the pressure distribution and vapor flow speed in the entire equipment which helps in understanding process nonuniformity, condenser overloading, etc.

#### ***4.2.3 ***Heat Transfer Coefficient \(***K******v***\)

A sublimation test with water runs is performed to determine the vial heat transfer coefficient \(*K*v\) for a given dryer. Since *K*v is dependent on vial configuration and chamber pressure, every time either is changed, during the life cycle management of the product, sublimation tests need to be performed. Changes in *K*v due to changes in vial configuration and chamber pressure can be relatively easy to predict with the use of an ab initio heat transfer model that, as illustrated in Fig. 11a, considers the conductive, radiative, and solid contact heat transfer contributions instead of running experiments on a manufacturing freeze dryer. For example, Fig. 11b shows that on a lab-scale lyophilizer, PilotLyo1, the modeled *K*v is in acceptable agreement with the experimentally obtained *K*v for PilotLyo1 \(with the error estimated\). It is seen from Fig. 11b as well as Fig. 3 earlier that experimental *K*v for lyophilizers in typical operating pressure \(50–250 mTorr\) ranges between 2 and 8 cal·s−1·cm−2·°C−1 \(or between 4 and 11 Joule·hr−1·cm−2·°C−1\), and the modeled *K*v would need to be carefully examined if it is found out of this range.

## **5 **Case Studies

### **5.1 **Construction of Design Space

Having characterized the freeze dryer and the manufacturing environment, the quasi steady-state model coupled with the CFD simulations can be used to construct a predictive knowledge space following the procedure described in Sect. 3.1 and can be employed to establish the equipment and process performance at the manufacturing scale \[19\]. Figure 12a, b, for example, show the design spaces computed based on the quasi-steady model for 5% mannitol in 6R vials on LabLyo2 and PilotLyo1, respectively. Within the design space/safe zone, a proven acceptable range, operating range/control space, and a set point can be created as illustrated in Fig. 12a, b. 
![](images/000024.jpeg)


***Fig. 12*** 
Design spaces created by coupled CFD and quasi-steady-state models to predict the equipment and process performance and guide operation: knowledge space includes the range of inputs that are studied \(inside of purple boundary\); Safe operating zone is bounded with choked flow limit and critical product temperature \(blue region\); control zone is bounded by the preferred range of maximum product temperature and chamber pressure \(inside of thick green triangle or quadrilateral\). The black traces are the calculated product temperature isotherms, where *T*eu is the experimental critical product temperature. The red traces are the calculated shelf temperature isotherms. The equipment capability is represented by the solid blue line \(due to choked flow\) and also the thin green line \(due to condenser overload\). \(**a**\) For LabLyo2. \(**b**\) For PilotLyo1



Construction of such a design space helps to identify the optimal conditions for a lyo process, the limits of failure and the limits \(ranges\) for validation and, the limits for process control for a given vial configuration, equipment, and manufacturing environment. Additionally, it can be used to predict the effect of variations in process conditions, on the process performance, and product quality attributes which helps in understanding the effects of excursions/deviations during manufacturing. Remember again that the validity and accuracy of the design spaces created on the manufacturing scale lyophilizer for the target product are completely dependent on the accuracy of the inputs to the model, including the scale-up strategy of *K*v and *R*p for the laboratory to manufacturing scale. The model can be further improved and validated along with more at-scale experimental data gathered as was discussed in Sect. 3.1.3.

### **5.2 **Effect of Batch Sizes \(Product Load\), Fill Volume, and Dose Strength

Product load or batch size influences the process performance, especially the primary drying time and heat transfer coefficient, and regulatory agencies expect revalidation of the process when the batch size is changed from within the validated range. For example, partial load drying process were performed on LabLyo1 with 100%, 10%, 5%, and 2% loads, and the associated heat transfer coefficient, *K*v, changes across load sizes were studied using first principles heat transfer model mentioned in earlier discussions. In Fig. 13d, the modeled change in batch averaged *K*v was compared with those experimentally extracted \[29\] \(using quasi-steady-state model as shown in Fig. 13a–c and reached good agreement \(5~7% difference\). 
![](images/000025.jpeg)

The red dashed line with spikes is the measured center vial temperature for the 100% load case, whereas the solid black, red, blue, and green solid lines are the batch average temperature, fitted using various *K*v to *t*Pri-Dry of the 100%, 10%, 5%, and 2% loads, respectively. \(**c**, **d**\) Experimental and predicted effect of load size in table and chart view, respectively. The percentage increase of *K*v \(batch-averaged by fitting to *t*Pri-Dry\) relative to 100% load for 100%, 10%, 5%, and 2% partial loads on LyoStar II \(in Patel et al. 2010, blue bar\) and LyoStar 3 \(experiment in dark orange bar and prediction in light orange bar\), respectively



Similarly, regulatory agencies expect revalidation of the process when the fill volume and/or dose strength is changed as they influence the lyophilization process performance and, consequently, the product quality attributes. Mathematical models based on quasi-steady-state, as described above, can be used to evaluate and predict the impact of changes in the vial sizes, fill volume, and dose strength on the process performance \(product temperature\) as illustrated below in Fig. 14. Figure 14a shows the modeled impact of changes in the fill volume on an amorphous-based formulation with 12% solid on a lab-scale lyophilizer, and Fig. 14b shows the impact of changing vial sizes for 1 mL of the same formulation. Figure 14c shows the modeled impact of the solid content of sucrose. 
![](images/000026.jpeg)


***Fig. 14*** 
Effect of \(**a**\) fill volume, \(**b**\) vial size, and \(**c**\) solid content concentration/*R*p on *T*pr\(*t*\) and *t*PriDry. In each subfigure, the red, green, and blue curves are the predicted product temperature in primary drying for each of the three varied conditions. The black dashed dot lines are the critical product temperature. \(**a**\) Effect of fill volume. \(**b**\) Effect of vial size. \(**c**\) Effect of the solid content



The results of simulations/predictions can be used to assess whether the impact of those changes is significant, insignificant, or within the acceptable criteria and to decide the need to revalidate the process or not. Similar to the design spaces presented in Sect. 5.1, again the validity and accuracy of the predicted influence of the dosage form selection on the lyophilization process performance are completely dependent on the accuracy of the inputs to the model. The properties of the final formulated product such as *T*c/*T*eu are critical and are a function of nature of API and corresponding dose strength. In the case of mAbs, for example, it is well documented that the delta between *T*c and *T*g′ increases as a function of increasing protein concentration, thereby allowing drying operation to occur at higher temperature. Similarly, increasing fill volume \(or correspondingly lowering vial dimensions\) imposes greater vapor flow restrictions during the drying process as illustrated in Fig. 14a, b. However, increasing concentration also results in an increase in mass transfer resistance \(Fig. 14c, d\), and thus caution must be taken to optimize the cycle for uniform drying without causing cake collapse. Additionally, maximum batch size should be established by taking not only the equipment capability such as minimum controllable chamber pressure as a function of sublimation rate but also by characterizing critical process parameters and their corresponding impact on product quality attributes as documented in Patel et al. \[21\] and Kshirsagar et al. \[23\].

### **5.3 **Controlled Ice Nucleation Technology \(CIN\) and Its Effect on Product Resistance

All solutions undergo supercooling during the freezing step. Supercooling occurs when nucleation of ice occurs at solution temperatures well below the equilibrium freezing point for the formulation. Conventional lyophilizers cool solutions by decreasing the shelf temperature over a specified time. Ice nucleation is not controlled during this approach and occurs randomly over a wide range of solution temperatures. There is often a higher degree of supercooling in the aseptic manufacturing area compared with the preparation of samples in a laboratory environment. Controlling the temperature at which ice nucleates can drastically reduce the variability between the vials on a shelf and between shelves, both at small-scale and at full-scale. Reducing the variability can ensure all product in all vials dry at a similar rate and should exhibit similar quality attributes such as appearance residual moisture and reconstitution time. This can have an added advantage of significantly reducing primary drying time. The possibilities for reducing variability and lyophilization processing time have increased the interest of pharmaceutical companies in CIN.

Controlled ice nucleation is a recent technology used during the freezing step of lyophilization that can reduce inter-vial variability in ice nucleation temperature. Reducing the variability in ice nucleation temperature can reduce the differences in product resistance, *R*p, during drying so that all vials in the batch exhibit similar behavior. Besides, a reduction in product resistance can reduce the drying time especially when nucleation occurs at higher temperatures. A reduction in *R*p occurs when there is a decrease in the surface area of ice as a result of conducting CIN at warmer temperatures resulting in large ice crystals that leave behind large pores in the drying solid. This can additionally reduce the interfacial interactions for molecules that are sensitive to interactions at the ice interface \[30\]. The larger pores resulting from CIN may improve reconstitution time for highly concentrated formulations and formulations containing large molecules by making it easier for the diluent to penetrate the lyophilized solid \[31\]. Improvements in the appearance of lyophilized solids may also be a result \[32, 33\].

Multiple methods have been investigated for controlling the nucleation of ice \[34\]. Two CIN methods are available at full-scale and one is available at a laboratory-scale. The methods available at the laboratory- and full-scale include rapid depressurization using ControLyo® and the introduction of an ice fog using VERISEQ® nucleation. FreezeBooster® also uses an ice fog for seeding nucleation and is available at a laboratory-scale.

A recent survey conducted by LyoHub found that more than ten pharmaceutical companies are testing and/or implementing rapid depressurization CIN technology at-scale, for multiple modalities, including monoclonal antibodies, vaccines, and gene/cell therapy products. A similar number \(more than 6–10\) of pharmaceutical companies are testing ice fog technology at scale, for monoclonal antibodies, vaccines, and small-molecules. Both technologies are amenable to implementation on new lyophilizers as well as to retrofitting current lyophilizers. In either case, depending on the CIN technology, modifications to the equipment design are needed. For example, in ControLyo® technology, additional depressurization valve\(s\) may be installed on the lyophilization chamber. Further, the depressurization valves need to be provided with additional nozzles to meet “Clean in Place” requirements. CIN software may be integrated into the lyophilizer control system or may be executed via a separate control system, and the output CIN parameters may be evaluated either as part of the lyophilizer batch record or separately using a validated system output when controlling CIN operation with a separate control system.

The typical goals for implementing CIN are to reduce variability and to reduce lyophilization processing time. The reduction in processing time may be more substantial for some formulations than for others. For example, amorphous formulations with low critical product temperatures often require conservative processing conditions to prevent collapse during primary drying. The conservative conditions often lead to longer than desired processing times. The use of controlled nucleation for such formulations can drastically reduce processing time. Experiments conducted at Baxter Healthcare using a 5% sucrose solution suggest that the processing time can be reduced by as much as 25 h at a laboratory scale \(Table 1\).

Several factors should be considered/studied at a laboratory-scale when designing a process using CIN \(Table 2\). One consideration is that the nucleation of ice starts at the top of the formulation and proceeds downward. This is the opposite of what occurs when using conventional \(random\) nucleation. 


***Table 2*** 
Considerations when using controlled ice nucleation



**Factor to consider**

**Comments**

For rapid depressurization

Gas type: N2 or Ar

Argon may be necessary when using vials 6 mL or less in size

Depressurization

Rate and magnitude of depressurization

For ice fog

Dispersion of ice nuclei

Adequate dispersion of the ice fog throughout the entire product chamber

For both methods

Ice nucleation temperature

Solution temperature prior to CIN affects success of CIN and also the drying time

Hold time prior to CIN

Ensure sufficient time to equilibrate solution temperature in all vials to ensure success of CIN

Ramp rate post ice nucleation

Slow ramp may encourage additional ice crystal growth



The factors described in Table 2 should be considered when designing studies at a laboratory-scale. The time needed for equilibration of temperature before ice nucleation may differ for different fill volumes and vial sizes. Insufficient equilibration time can prevent nucleation from occurring when desired. Ramp rates post-nucleation should also be considered. However, this is typically dictated by the capability of the lyophilizer at full-scale. Most lyophilizers cannot proceed any faster than about 1 °C /min at full-scale.

Transferring the process to full-scale relies on typical lyophilizer qualification as described in other sections of this document. One of the important variables at full-scale includes proving adequate control of shelf temperature under various load conditions. Increasing the thermal load in the lyophilizer may require longer hold times before ice nucleation to ensure equilibration of solution temperature in the vials.

Once the suitable CIN technology is selected, extensive characterization of the CIN process should be initiated. As a general strategy, small-scale CIN experiments may be first performed to determine the minimum \(worst-case\) ice nucleation conditions for successful CIN. Additional experiments may be performed to evaluate the impact of selected CIN parameters on lyophilized cake attributes such as residual moisture. This will help establish the boundary conditions for the CIN process parameters to achieve the desired process/product performance. Once the small-scale ranges are defined, CIN cycles may be performed at the manufacturing scale to establish the CIN parameter robustness at scale.

Proving the method is operational post-installation at the manufacturing scale may require engineering batches that examine the performance of the CIN method apart from examining the performance of other usually tested lyophilization parameters. For example, rapid depressurization requires that the gas leaves the chamber as fast as possible. This may be hindered by the size of the port, the actuation valve, or if a sterilizing grade filter is used on the exit of the port. If so, additional ports may be necessary. Appropriate use of the ice fog method requires that the ice nuclei rapidly flow into the product chamber and reach all vials located on all shelves. Therefore, it is important to consider the flow patterns of the ice nuclei in the chamber.

Hold times and cooling ramp rates may be important in decreasing the variability of ice nucleation and crystal growth. Some studies suggest that some molecules may be sensitive to long residence times in the freeze concentrate above the glass transition \(*T*g′\) and may adversely impact stability. Results from Merck labs showed that for certain proteins and viruses, longer time in solution \(TIS\) during the CIN shelf temperature may lead to degradation during the frozen \[35\]. This would necessitate limiting the pre-ice/post-ice nucleation hold time range and might even render CIN an unfavorable option in some cases.

Apart from the CIN parameter optimization/robustness, media fills also need to be performed to ensure that the contents of the lyophilizer will remain sterile post CIN. CIN conditions should be simulated \(or even challenged\) during the media fills. For example, during ControLyo®, media fill studies may be performed to evaluate the ability of the fill-finish process \(including CIN\) to maintain sterility, using worst-case CIN parameters \(e.g., highest depressurization magnitude\) as the worst case for sterility. The impact of high pressure on microbial growth may also need to be evaluated before performing the media fills.

## **6 **Summary

The validation activities of pharmaceutical lyophilization for Stage 1 \(Process Design\), Stage 2 \(Process Qualification\) and Stage 3 \(Continued Process Verification\) are considered in this work along with relevant case studies. In Part I, the process design approach relying on generating a design space for a given product and equipment combination is presented and illustrated with examples from practice. Applications of modeling in process design and scale-up are also presented while showcasing the impact of facility, equipment, and *K**v*. New and upcoming approaches to process improvement product monitoring and process understanding with an emphasis on CMC requirements are discussed as well. Furthermore, illustrative case studies are documented for multiple vial sizes, fill volumes, and dosage strengths to demonstrate the value of modeling. These activities are aimed at enhancing process understanding in preparation for Stages 2 and 3 of the validation processes described in the companion Part II of the paper.
